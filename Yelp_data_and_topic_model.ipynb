       "[[<p lang=\"en\">Prime location for a theater weekend or time spent in midtown Manhattan. Broadway shows were right around the corner and a short walk to Rockefeller center and 5th Avenue shopping. <br>Thoroughly enjoyed my 2 night stay at this location. We booked a king size corner room that promised views of the Hudson and Time Square. We checked in around noon and received a room on the 55 floor with a wonderful view. Our room had an adjoining door to the room next door so there was some occasional noise but nothing that proved to be a problem. <br>The room was well styled and clean with a fainting chair, the bathroom was New York small but had all the essentials. Like all W hotels we had tons of Bliss products to choose from. The only mirror in the whole room was in the bathroom so it was difficult for 2 of us to get ready simultaneously. <br>All of the staff was friendly, from check in to doormen and concierge, everyone was very polite and helpful. <br>They have a great bar with a DJ starting at 11 every night where we enjoyed a drink after our play Friday night. <br>We ate breakfast at Blue fin, one of 2 restaurants in the hotel. It was delicious and had a good variety of menu items to choose from. <br>Would definitely return the next time I plan a similar trip!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Spectacular King (one night) Experience. <br><br>So annoyed I decided to write my first ever review of a location/experience. <br>I'm giving two stars because the location is very nice, also a few staff members made moments of the stay very enjoyable. For example.. a very large gentleman outside who looks more of a bouncer than bellhop. He was just great. This man who's name I can't remember took extra time to have a very nice conversation with my girlfriend and me as we waited for our car to return from the valet. <br>You sir are one this location needs to learn from. <br><br>We stayed one night in a spectacular king. <br>Room was very nice, the view was amazing. FYI the bathrooms are frosted glass in a somewhat small room so bringing a new girlfriend here brings you two very close after a full meal.. If you catch my drift, haha she probably did. <br><br>-Very large tv <br><br>-curtains are a little hard to pull but they are also sturdy so it makes sense.<br> <br>-One of the electrical outlet's by the nightstand, in order to reach it you have to move the whole stand. I found that a little weird and was worried about breaking something. Did it anyway #donttellmehowtofreedom<br><br>-They offer a \\xa0DeSanti water bottle by the ice bucket for free, while teasing you with a smart water for $7 right next to the bed. That's fine just don't roll over and take a sip after a long night of drinks at local bars. <br><br>Valet is around $70 and I did find a spot just two blocks away that I am almost positive is where they actually parked our car for much cheaper. Still without my awesome valet experience my rating would be even lower. Do it it's worth the cash. <br><br>Here's the messed up parts:<br>By the time my plane landed in Florida we had a charge for $286.80. <br>I called right away but was told that I needed to speak with accounting who didn't return until Monday morning. I find out that the charges were for a robe and smoking in the non smoking room. <br><br>Only problem is we would never smoke inside. the hotel staff found an empty pack of cigarettes in the room and took this as and I quote the management staff on this \"evidence of the offense\". <br><br>The robe ehhh. I mean normally if one of my friends told me they got charged for a robe and they didn't take it. I would say they were lying and ask to borrow the robe. This time however the robe that was originally in our room had a stain. So my girlfriend asked the cleaning lady for a new one in exchange. Not sure where the mix up happened but we ended up being charged basically for not using a what looked like doo doo stained one. <br><br>Here's what pissed me off. The hotel took less than three hours to charge us. But over 24hours to give me ANY sort of answer or even acknowledgment that I would recieve a call back from my many calls/voicemails. <br>Finally I called and added a little more tone to my voice this got me on the phone with a manager who said I never had to speak to accounting in the first place. She gave me a rundown of the CSI level investigation they did to find the empty pack of cigarettes and wasn't sure about the robe. <br>I wonder if because I left a bag of chips I can expect charges from the mini bar as well since that's the level of assumption this hotel likes to use.<br><br>The charges were removed only because the manager- quote again \"didn't want to go back and forth about it\" and I was informed that I can look forward to seeing that $287 in 5-7 business days. Thanks because bills aren't due or anything I'm sure they can wait. <br><br>Look I get all of these things happen but the way the staff handled everything afterwords and the lack of urgency by anyone to get back to me is beyond upsetting. Especially considering how much one nights stay can cost here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I was a little worried to book this place for a work trip after reading the mixed reviews but it was the best Starwood property steps away from my meeting at 3 Times Square. <br><br>I landed late and didn't check in until 1am. The woman at the front desk was fast and put me on a high floor so the noise wouldn't bother me. <br><br>Room was great, 48th floor and remodeled. I ordered a Cesar salad with shrimp and it was amazing. There was also an afternoon I needed a snack at 3:30pm and Blue Fin had perfect sushi and friendly staff. <br><br>I was only here for about 24 hours but loved my stay and will definitely be back the next time I have a meeting in the area.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Great location right in the heart of all the action on Broadway close to the theatres. \\xa0The hallways are very dark which when coming in late at night just feels insecure. \\xa0The room was tiny with two double beds, three people staying--I get it this is NYC, but still, we were constantly knocking into a bed or the other furniture. \\xa0<br><br>Unfortunately, we had toilet problems the first night--it just stopped flushing. \\xa0I called guest services and they said they would send someone up--that took almost an hour. \\xa0After messing with the toilet for almost another hour he said it was fixed, ok great. \\xa0We had the SAME problem the next night after returning from a long day, they sent another guy who used a toilet snake and destroyed the ceramic at the bottom of the toilet, completely scratched, just looked disgusting. \\xa0They offered to switch our rooms, but this was our second night and we only had one left so we stayed--it would have been nice if they offered a room switch the first night.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">The W takes the W.<br><br>This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Take that with a grain of salt as the only other \"fancy\" hotel I've stayed at was for my wedding. Even so, this is still a great place. Though I arrived early and my room wasn't ready yet, the concierge took my bags for me and called me when my room was ready. <br><br>The W is a dark themed hotel. Doormen open the doors for you and walk into a dark lobby area that has waterfall ambiance and two elevators. The elevators take you to the main lobby where there is a bar, piano, and areas to lounge. There are even little VIP nook areas with couches to socialize somewhat privately. Check-in at the front desks on your left out of the elevator and walk to the back left area to get to the elevators that take you to your room. <br><br>My room was great. Clean white themed room. Sharp edges and smooth counter tops. I didn't want to put my things anywhere as I felt it would disturb the perfect room vibes. It seems like hotels like this always have plenty of large mirrors and excellent lighting. There were plenty of outlets, working space, and bathroom items to get freshened up. My room was outside of a huge LED, as the W is located in the middle of Time Square, but the curtains in the room are black out so it was a nuisance in the morning. <br><br>Not much more to say, but if I could choose to stay here, on business of course, I would. Otherwise, it will cost you a pretty penny for this prime location.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">W New York Times Square is perfect choice for tourists and/or business trips. The location is close to subway and major tourist attractions. On this visit, I was upgraded to a corner suite by Alice Allaire at the highest floor. Alice also provided sparkling wine on my room which was a nice touch for SPG Platinum members. W Times Square is a nice change from sad Marriott hotels in the city. I would stay here again!</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Zero privacy in the bathroom. Frosted glass is pointless because you can see right through it and certainly hear everything through it. <br><br>The halls are overly dark which makes it a bit sketchy at night. I am not sure what the point of this is since security should be #1 and this doesn't scream \"I feel safe.\"<br><br>The mobile key system is hit or miss. The front desk told me they have had many people complain about this today and they are not sure what the issue is. This is not the end of the world but kind of funny since they push it so hard and then it doesn't work. <br><br>Room furniture is in disrepair and should be an embarrassment to the hotel given the price they charge for the rooms. When I spoke to one of the managers she apologized for the quality of the room and offered a hotel use credit for room service, etc. Not really the point but they are not rushing to fix anything. <br><br>The space to store clothes for a little longer stay is non existent. The mini fridge has a pay to consume policy but you can take the stuff out and leave it on the desk until leave then they put it back. Hot,cold,hot,cold beer. Yuck!<br><br>No fan in this wonderful bathroom so after you get out of the shower you are sweating already. Add that to the half USED shampoo left in my shower and it is just nast</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">This place has a good bar on the rooftop where the happy hour on Sunday's is pretty good, and you get an awesome view of the city, there is several seating avail. It even has a secluded area for smoking if you're a smoker, it has tables and chairs. \\xa0Drinks are decent too I would say pretty strong, you will not be disappointed!

       "  <p lang=\"en\">When writing reviews I always try to separate my personal issues and peeves from my reviews. \\xa0In this case it will be difficult. \\xa0Here goes...<br><br>Hubby booked us into this hotel and I was excited to finally check out a W hotel because I've always heard good things. \\xa0I was a little cautious when he told me we were staying in Times Square because I can't imagine a place more touristy and loud. \\xa0<br><br>The entryway of the hotel is super cool at night with water flowing above your head and reflecting down into the lower lobby. \\xa0Neat! \\xa0Check-in was easy. \\xa0Great neon features in the upper lobby.<br><br>The rooms were adequate. \\xa0Appeared clean but a bit worn. \\xa0I immediately noted the lack of a coffee maker and was horrified (not really!) but I do like to have a coffee maker in the room. \\xa0Our sink was cloggie but I didn't feel like spending my short vacay with the handyman so we worked with it. \\xa0So far, so good. \\xa0We had a great view.<br><br>The real problems started at night. \\xa0We had terrible noise from a party in the adjacent room as well as street noise. \\xa0We repeated called security about the full on party. \\xa0They came three times, blah, blah, blah. \\xa0Fast forward to a night of no sleep. \\xa0The manager called to apologize in the morning. \\xa0Not much he could do because the hotel was full and our room could not be changed. \\xa0I do think he might have offered something after our hell-night.<br><br>In summary. \\xa0If you are hosting a rave or an all night party this is the hotel for you. \\xa0If you are a middle aged family type stay elsewhere. \\xa0I haven't researched thoroughly but I would stay on the outskirts of Central Park next time. \\xa0The hotel itself is a solid A-okay three stars but I wouldn't take my chances with the noise and chaos again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">It's true, if you like quiet (like me) the W in Times Square is not the place for you. But there were things that I thought they would have down at a basic level.<br><br>Disappointments:<br>- Walls and doors were thin so I could hear doors slamming and conversations in the room next door. Also, the shade that covers the windows isn't very effective at keeping the Times Square light out so you can still see some \"daylight\" coming through the shade and on the sides. \\xa0<br>- Lighting. I know that the W is supposed to be cool and sexy but I seriously could barely see well enough in the room to get dressed. The lights by the night stand aren't functional since they don't provide enough light to read...so you really have to get out of bed to turn off the lights. <br>- Housekeeping didn't replace the glasses (just took away the dirty ones) I used or the bathroom products I used<br>- Overall, the rooms need a refresh as everything is just slightly worn down and a bit frayed. <br><br>A smoke alarm went off in the middle of the night which is obviously out of their control but certainly an annoyance to all guests. <br><br>While this wasn't an issue for me, there are hotel rooms directly across the elevator doors. I can't believe that people have to stay in those rooms as they would be terribly loud. \\xa0<br><br>On the positive side, it's very closely situated to broadway shows and things of the like if that's what you're doing but the Times Square location is otherwise a car and pedestrian quagmire.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I can hear everything that is going on right outside of our door. <br>2. The windows don't work. You hear everything thing that happening even though you're 55 floors up. While they are closed. <br>3. The hallways are dimly lit. It's not creepy. But you would think they would have installed better lighting. <br>4. Our door didn't close correctly, we had one of the guys that work in the building that were looking for a tray. Open the door from the outside. We were in the room, but my cousin who was sharing a room with me wasn't decent. And basically had to run for cover. So much for privacy. <br>5. We had a roll in bathroom, and the water would get all over the floor. <br><br>Over all, the hotel is beautiful. But it's beauty isn't going to give it 5 stars. Sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The ground level entrance has waterfall for walls, and shallow pond for a ceiling, which makes for a trippy and W-esque scene. Check in on the 7th floor is manned by courteous and polite staff. At night the lounge is filled with clubby / edm / eurotrash music.<br><br>I booked an ultra cool corner room (corner of 47 x Broadway), but at check in was given a standard room that only had a view of 47th. I explained the situation to the check in agent and the issue was resolved and I was put in the room I booked.<br><br>Don't expect your view of Time Square to be extraordinary because of the billboards, signs, ladders, and fire escape scaffolding outside of the building.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Typical city W, bold, funky, bright. Rooms are nice and comfortable, had very nice view from my room. Beds, shower, bathroom, amenities all cool, friendly service. No complaints. Being Starwood Gold helps with some perks. Expensive, since it is prime location. Would recommend if the price is right.</p>,\n",

For $300+ per night an extra hour would've been appreciated.<br>- There's no parking, but W is supposed to have a deal with Icon parking for a discounted rate. NYC has several Icon parking Garages, but for some reason the lot closet to the hotel didn't honor any discount for hotel guests. Super confusing. The front desk agents didn't know either and couldn't direct us to the proper Icon garage location. <br><br>Other notes:<br>-In the heart of Times Square.<br>- Once you walk in the front entrance, the lobby is on the 7th floor.<br>- Great bar and cool social scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

It's more of a darker, \"burlesque\" feel and there were random customers in various stages of inebriation dancing to the music being played by the DJ. And this was on a Tuesday night! They have large booths for large parties. Overall the prices are no different than any other bar in midtown.</p>,\n",

       " [<p lang=\"en\">The W New York - Union Square is a lovely property, located on the northeast corner of Union Square, at 17th and Park, an excellent home base for any trip to New York. The hotel has a great boutique feel to it, seeing that this property was formerly the Guaranty Life building, dating back to the early 20th century. Much of the beaux-arts architectural features are still evident throughout the property, including the adornments surrounding the elevators. <br><br>The rooms themselves are quite nice, feeling particularly spacious due to their very high ceilings, with a modern flair and comfortable bedding. The headboard in each room is a stylized map of the Union Square area (and I hate to admit that I didn't realize that until my fourth stay). Rooms on the upper floors facing south (on the 17th Street side) have a great view of Union Square, downtown Manhattan, and One World Trade. The bathrooms are stocked with Bliss products, and who doesn't like to start off the day with some Soapy Suds?<br><br>There's a nice on-property bar/restaurant named Irvington that I've written about in a separate review (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/irvington-new-york?hrid=qnn7eexvMEVnbMNziklUdQ&amp;utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=(direct))\">yelp.com/biz/irvington-n\\u2026</a>. You should definitely stop in for a drink while you're at the hotel - perfect for a pre-theatre cocktail or a post-dinner night-cap. Try their barrel-aged Manhattan - it's tops.<br><br>What makes this place special is its top-notch staff. Unlike many Manhattan properties, the personal touch is more than evident here, with the staff going above and beyond to make sure everything is just right. Before I arrived for my most recent stay, I got in touch with Natacia, the lovely Welcome Desk Talent Coach who I had met on a previous stay, to let her know that we'd be celebrating a close friend's 50th birthday. Not only did she arrange for rooms with a great view of Union Square, but I've also nicknamed her the 'birthday elf' for being so nice as to have a bottle of prosecco delivered to the birthday boy's room, where we enjoyed a celebratory glass (or three) before heading out for dinner. <br><br>There's many more people I can say great things about, like Stella, who helped me with my reservation over the phone, to Tiffany, who made sure everything was just right at check-in, to the ever-so-riendly housekeeper assigned to my room over the weekend, with everyone doing their part to make sure that this was a picture-perfect stay. It's people like these who keep me coming back to the W New York - Union Square, people who make us feel like welcome guests in their home, something I particularly appreciate when my travels bring me back to my hometown. Huzzah!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I am SPG Gold and I've stayed at this property probably eight times in the past year and I will never do it again. First off, they don't read your reservation notes, so if you request a high floor or a bath tub or away from the elevator, they don't read the notes. They're going to give you whatever they feel like giving you and it'll be wrong and you will have to argue to get to the right room. This happens to me *every* *single* *time*.<br><br>I would rather stay at a subpar Sheraton four points than deal with the BS of this hotel ever again. I am sick of it. They write you polite little emails but they do not take action and they do not care to make things right. <br><br>I checked in exhausted after a redeye today only to find out that they put me on the fifth floor above a freaking jackhammer. I've never had such a low floor in any of my visits and the irony is I actually spent MORE money this time to pay for a nicer room. Except they forgot to read my notes that I requested a bathtub and used the excuse that they had to give me a low floor in order to give me the bathroom. Screw you W Union Square. <br><br>Never never again. <br><br>I'll go to Kimpton or the Sheraton four points but I will never visit this property again, I am sick of the lack of customer service. I don't know who they're prioritizing, but it sure is isn't their elite members.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I love Starwoods Hotels. And I used to come here when the bar was Olives. Now it's something else, but the hotel bar is a FANTASTIC place to grab drinks and catch-up with friends. Amazing cocktails, atmosphere and photo opps! The hotel rooms are fashionable and swanky too. You will impress people with it's location and accommodations if you decide to host a function in NYC and make this your residence of choice. <br><br>That said, the bathroom situation is a nightmare for lobby visitors. If you are pregnant, have the intestinal track of a maltese puppy, etc... perhaps avoid this spot for a bit. I waited for the hostess to return to get the key-card access, and she did not reappear. Five-ish minutes go by and I went to the hotel front desk, and then my worst nightmare of a \"helpful person\" (Lord, why did it have to be a woman in these political times) directed me to walk up the grand staircase, down the hall, and that maybe someone will let you in.....But she really didn't know and there was no eye contact. Getting a bit desperate, I climbed upstairs and trekked the hall and turned the corner and ...nothing. Nobody letting me in. Marathoned myself back downstairs, now begging for a solution (crossing my legs). \"I'M ON DUH PHONE! STOPS YELLING AND ASKING ME FOR THINGS!\" Thanks so much for your help as you pretend to be on the phone. Who was yelling? Because I'm desperate.<br><br>Passing the empty hostess stand, I run over to my husband, the bride and groom-friends at the restaurant and I'm all, \"I have to find a potty STAT!\" My husband is the one that stays there the most and was like \"Duh! There is one in the basement! Where have you been going?\" What? Why was I directed up the stairs a mile away to a locked bathroom??? <br><br>I give it five stars because I still love Starwoods. And some people are ugly and mean past midnight and assume you are a homeless bum wanting to use a bathroom. I get it. But unhelpful employees are the type of talent I'd like to know about as a manager. Dare me. I will birth a baby or worse on a floor in the name of justice. I will start a parade of paying customers to join in my cause. Are we still talking about a potty??? Sorry. This was just last night. Still steaming. Breathe. HeeeHeeeHooooooooo! HeeeHeeeHooooooooo!<br><br>5 Stars! Fun story to tell my friends!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">At over $400 a night, I expected way better. When we arrived, we were told that the only room left was a wheelchair accessible one, so we took it. The closet was very low, which was quite inconvenient. The room was also very small. One of the lamps was broken, and they didn't realize until we called the front desk several nights into our stay. Our swipe cards were disabled before check out, so we had to go to the front desk to get it worked out. There is also no sense of luxury or grandeur. I would not stay again.</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here for 5 nights for a business trip. It's pretty convenient to most things I needed to get to. And that's about the only good thing I can say about the hotel. I booked a \"Wonderful View\" room, it was mediocre at best. When I checked in they only had the wheelchair accessible room left which has the cost hangers at waist level. They offered to move me the next day, but if I've already booked a non handicap room why should I have to be moved, especially in a 4 star hotel. The desk lamp was constantly flickering so I had to call the front desk to replace the lightbulb. On the 4th night of my stay, My key card got disabled so I went for an elevator ride with other guests got off so I can back to the lobby to get my card reactivated. Despite the room called \"Wonderful View\", the view was pretty bad, we faced the corner of another building so the only wonderful view I had was a brick wall. Some minor positives of the place were the bathroom amenities, they were nicely scented and the cleaning staff did a wonderful job every day. Wouldn't stay here again for $400+ per night.</p>,\n",

       "  <p lang=\"en\">Fairly Average. Nice looking, but still a little old and has some cracks and dust (also I had a leaky faucet) but definitely a central location and friendly staff. I'd stay again. <br>Additional info: They have a gym in the basement, a business center, and it's $6.95 to use the computer for a few minutes, and 40 cents to print a page in black and white, and $1 to print in color. <br>Wifi is complimentary but you can upgrade to faster wifi for additional $.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Centrally located, the W is a great hotel to stay at. If you have kids, it's even better, since they're right across the street from a Barnes and Noble (with a great kid's section) and the Union Square playground. <br><br>The Union Square train station is a block down, and you can go almost anywhere with the trains that stop there (NQR456L). <br><br>Their lobby is chic and spacious with high ceilings. Their rooms are spacious for NYC standards and are decorated to the T. We stayed in a 'Fantastic Suite' and it was so comfortable for two people. The bathroom was definitely bigger than average, with a stall and a tub and was filled with tons of Bliss products. They provided plenty of towels, so there was no need to call for extra. Their beds and pillows were a dream to sleep on, and the couch was comfy as well. Their windows had ledges (on the inside) that were spacious enough to climb up and sit down on, which was definitely one of my favorite parts of the room! It was amazing to see all of downtown from my window (we were on the 20th floor), and a great space to wind down with a book from a busy day!<br><br>The staff are friendly and extremely attentive! We've ordered in and even the staff there were extremely friendly. Definitely worth the visit!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       "  <p lang=\"en\">I was a little baffled at the low ratings of this hotel. I have to say that out of all the times I frequent New York (and that is quite often) and need to stay in a hotel, the W Hotel in Union Square is my favorite. <br><br>The location is unbeatable. You're just a block from the 14th Street subway which has the L, N, Q, R, 4, 5, 6, and 6X lines. It's also just a few blocks from the PATH train line as well. So you can literally go anywhere in New York, making it super convenient and easy. I personally love this area because there are so many great restaurants, coffee shops, and things to do within a 5-10 minute walking distance. <br><br>The hotel itself is beautiful. The front desk always has some sort of beverage available (e.g. champagne, cider, infused water), and the foyer is open and has high ceilings. The rooms are great too. They're spacious for NYC hotel standards. The beds are so comfortable and they don't cheap out on the number of pillows. The bathrooms are large too, with an abundance of Bliss products and shower head with a consistent water flow that isn't super powerful like they're washing elephants or dribbling like they're short on water. Everything in the room is clean and up-to-date. <br><br>I've never had a trouble with staff. In fact, from the doorman to the concierge, everyone's super friendly and accommodating. Plus the hotel bar, the Irvington, isn't too bad for food and drinks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">We've stayed at this W hotel before and it's one we like better than some others. \\xa0My husband and I are probably a little outside the demographic of most W hotels. \\xa0They usually have a very big bar scene - sometimes to the extent we have a hard time getting into the hotel at night and certainly if we want to partake of the bar ourselves, it's near impossible. \\xa0That is not so at this particular W. \\xa0it is a bit on the quieter side and we like it like that. \\xa0<br><br>We've had larger and smaller rooms. \\xa0This visit we only asked for a standard room. \\xa0The room (especially the bed) was very comfortable. \\xa0Previously we had been able to open the windows at this location (which we enjoy) and when we went to open the window on this visit there was definitely something wrong with the window. \\xa0We reported it to the front desk who explained that the windows should've been locked shut and a new safety precaution. \\xa0Our room was handicap accessible so the bathroom was fairly large, but oddly enough when we went to hang up our clothes we only had a low hanging bar. \\xa0We were in town for a black tie wedding so I had no where to hang my gown except on the automatic door closure behind the door. \\xa0Sort of strange.<br><br>There is a bar in the lobby as well as a restaurant in the hotel. \\xa0Very nice that they offer free coffee in the morning in the lobby and gave us a glass of prosecco when we arrived!<br><br>This is really a nice hotel. \\xa0The staff is great. \\xa0Friendly and accommodating. \\xa0Excellent location. \\xa0Would certainly stay there again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       "  <p lang=\"en\">Never again.<br><br>I stay at SPG properties all over the world, which includes a lot of Ws. This is the worst by far. Like another reviewer, I would rather stay at a random Sheraton For Points than there. <br><br>There is a shocking lack of service -- they have several staff members hanging out by the doors, who literally don't bother to open the door for you as you walk in or out. I have never seen that before. I am not saying staff should rush over the open the door, but if I am walking in and they are just standing there and chatting and see me approach -- what exactly is in their job description then? No one offered any help when I got out of a cab with my bags before I checked in, either.<br><br>I am SPG Platinum, which means they are supposed to provide an upgraded room, if available. When I checked in, they told me nothing was available. Out of curiosity (it was early Jan -- usually not very busy for NYC hotels), I looked online, and there were multiple rooms available (I am not talking one or two -- literally multiple). When I asked them about it, they told me those rooms were booked up... right. I can believe that one or two bookings didn't catch up online inventory, but it is doubtful that it was the case for every single room category. It took a call to the Platinum Concierge to finally get upgraded. At that point, it was a matter of principle -- I don't really care about the actual upgrade, but I hate being lied to. <br><br>To add insult to injury -- I opted to take my 500SPG points as a bonus; in the statement, they indicated that I had taken a free breakfast instead. I am not sure if they are just inattentive or they are trying to short change guests on points. Too bad -- I am in NYC for 5 or so nights every couple of weeks and I can certainly take my business elsewhere. <br><br>They have a lot of random weird things about their hotel. They had what appeared to be coffee in the lobby, which turned out to be hot chocolate. That's nice, except it was not marked as such, and it was lukewarm several times I tried it. Getting cold hot chocolate when you expect coffee is certainly surprising -- whatever happened to just having hot coffee on hand for your guests? <br><br>Oh, and their mobile check in didn't work -- I believe the W Times Sq has a functioning process for that, which is a lot more convenient.<br><br>If you are looking for an SPG property in the city, W Times Sq is not much better in terms of comfort, but at least has attentive staff who seem to be honest in their communications. Westin Times Sq is also better. Even Sheraton TriBeCa, (which is probably half the price), is better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">This is regarding the bar in the lobby. \\xa0Terrible service. \\xa0Yes, it's Manhattan but the drinks are stupid expensive and it is impossible to get served. \\xa0However, even worse, they served two VERY DRUNK/Couldn't walk young men who were loud, obnoxious and rude to my date. \\xa0If it wasn't for my date grabbing my arm to stop me more than a few times, they would have been hurt and I likely would have been in trouble. \\xa0I saw the staff including the manager noticing their loud outbursts, banding their hands on the bar, etc. \\xa0Nobody said or did anything. \\xa0 The bar was full, so we couldn't even move away from them, so I was stuck . I will NEVER return to that bar and it's sad for me because I work 50 feet from the entrance.</p>,\n",

The roof offers a great view of Hollywood and parts of L.A. We really enjoyed ourselves and had a great time.

       "  <p lang=\"en\">W is a lifestyle brand and therefore, has its own unique, modern, hip, whimsical, and abstract yet upscale vibe. \\xa0W Hollywood is no exception and is conveniently located in the heart of all the Hollywood action on Hollywood Blvd. \\xa0I'm giving W Hollywood 4 stars for its convenient, accessible location, superb customer service, wonderful rooms (pun intended...they have rooms called \"Wonderful\"), fun rooftop pool, and good food. \\xa0As someone who has stayed here many, many times throughout the years, I would say that W Hollywood consistently deserves their 4-star rating. \\xa0<br><br>TIP: \\xa0If you're an SPG member, W Hollywood is probably my favorite property in LA for its well-rounded experience: location, customer service, comfort, amenities, and food. \\xa0<br><br>Solid location. \\xa0If you want to be in the heart of Hollywood with easy access to bars and restaurants (for locals) and tourist attractions, W Hollywood does not disappoint. \\xa0Everything is at your fingertips whether you want to walk and immerse yourself in the cooky local culture and people watch or take a short Uber ride. \\xa0<br><br>Super customer service. \\xa0The W brand is reputed for its \"Whatever-whenever\" motto and the staff at W Hollywood adheres to this philosophy. \\xa0Whether you are being welcomed by the front desk, the promptness and thoroughness of the maid service, turndown service, breakfast or pool service, the staff is courteous, friendly, and will, to the extent possible, bend over backwards to ensure that you have a memorable experience. \\xa0Specifically, the staff at the pool, even on super busy days, are hospitable and their overall positive, upbeat demeanor really enhances your enjoyment.<br><br>Wonderful rooms. \\xa0As SPG platinum members, we always get suites so I can't really speak to the regular rooms; however, based on consistency here and globally (we have stayed at many global W locations and even have a full-time suite at W Bangkok, Thailand), I can only assume that they are equally clean and comfortable. \\xa0I did read that other reviewers mentioned dirty pillows and carpet. \\xa0I can say that I haven't experienced this personally at any of the W properties that I've stayed (my boyfriend specifically had over 365 nights last year) but if you bring this to the attention of the staff, they will do everything to correct the issue immediately and probably offer a conciliatory complimentary service or benefit. \\xa0W Hotels will do their absolute best to uphold their reputation, including bending over backwards to accommodate any reasonable request or complaint. \\xa0<br><br>In general, the bathrooms are large and spacious with plenty of counter space. \\xa0They do provide everything that you could need including Bliss toiletries, a powerful blow dryer, even shoe polish, to name a few. \\xa0The beds are comfortable and the rooms are relatively quiet.<br><br>TIP: \\xa0If you want to enjoy the pool on a hot day, come early to reserve a lounge chair. \\xa0<br><br>Rooftop pool. \\xa0I would say that the Wet Deck is one of the most fun pools in LA. \\xa0The pool is not big, but it's big enough. \\xa0They do have cabanas that you can reserve with bottle service for $500+. \\xa0I'm speaking for one specific occasion when my friend and I wanted to stay at the hotel to go out the previous night and hang out at the pool the following day. \\xa0We came to the pool a little late and all the lounge chairs were being used. \\xa0We considered paying the $500 for a cabana (I typically don't like scrounging off another group because then you have to deal with unsavory advances and didn't want my friend who came to visit me from across the country not to have a fun time at the pool); however, the waitstaff noticed that we were just two girls, said it wouldn't really be worth it for us and within 20 minutes, were able to wrangle two lounge chairs for us. \\xa0I really appreciate when the staff has an opportunity to upsell but instead, opt to hook you up without an ulterior motive except to simply be nice (they were two female waitresses before you guys dismiss this gesture).<br><br>My favorite thing about W Hollywood is hanging out at the pool. \\xa0Each of the several times that I've been has never disappointed; \\xa0the people who go are generally very friendly and social. \\xa0<br><br>Good food. \\xa0There are a ton of local food options in LA, Hollywood is no exception. \\xa0I've never actually eaten a meal at a restaurant at the hotel but have had room service and food at the pool. \\xa0The food is certainly not gourmet quality but garners a solid 3.5 stars for being tasty enough. \\xa0The drinks are great with a higher than average alcohol to mixer ratio. \\xa0 <br><br>Overall, W Hollywood is a really fun hotel that is in a great location, offers comfortable accommodations, pretty good food and a staff that works to ensure that your excursion is enjoyable and memorable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Or if you are a baller like me jk they run about 400-600 bucks but you get drinks for your money so if you have a crew that can but them back... This is a good idea. \\xa0<br><br>Food<br>I don't eat here<br><br>Service <br>The bouncers are cool just make sure you wear a collard shirt if you are a guy or they won't let you in. \\xa0The girl that hands out wristbands (which you will need if you want to go close the stage is a sweetie). Bar tenders are really cool not uptight or cocky like some places in Hollywood.<br><br>Misc<br>There is always a great show!!! The singers are amazing and you never know who will be doing a special number from tap dancers to Nicole Scherzinger. \\xa0Check it out it is the best thing to do on a Sunday night!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Was not in the least crowded however it took us two hours to receive and finish a few appetizers and drinks.

After reserving their \"Wonderful Room\" and checking in, I was asked if I want to downgrade to a regular room since there is loud construction outside their Wonderful Rooms.

       " [<p lang=\"en\">If this hotel is good enough for a Presidential candidate, it's good enough for me. Don't get me wrong, it was a little annoying with all the Secret Service here but it did make the stay more memorable. The W is located in a residential area in Beverly Hills. It's very trendy hotel with a waterfall staircase and neon lights leading into the hotel. Lobby is also very modern and has a steakhouse (STK). Rooms are spacious and mini bar is full with drinks/snacks. They also have complimentary Dasani water. <br><br>Christine Han reached out to me prior to my stay. She had a very informative email sent to me and also accommodated my request for a higher floor. When I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised that she put me on the Pent House floor.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for vacation or business. Solid hotel in LA.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">When the W first opened it was fantastic, and the remodel some years ago modernized the place. \\xa0Unfortunately it seems like those were the \"glory days\", as the hotel now appears dated, dark, and in need of a face lift. \\xa0Please note this is only a review of the property and the downstairs bar/lounge/restaurant areas; I did not stay at the hotel and thus can't comment on the rooms. \\xa0<br><br>Purple up-lighting and purple overhead lighting pretty much set the tone. \\xa0Those colors made the areas feel smaller, cold, and made it very difficult to read menus. \\xa0Why not brighten the decor and lighting to give the property a more open and inviting feel? \\xa0Also, the seating areas at the lounge left much to be desired. \\xa0Without the included throw pillows it would have been near impossible to comfortably sit. \\xa0Even with the pillows - which constantly shift around - I could never find the right seating position.<br><br>The service also missed the mark for most of the night. \\xa0It took about 10 minutes after I sat down at the booth for my server to arrive with the menu. \\xa0The bartender knew I opted to sit there, so he could/should have instructed the server to stop by shortly thereafter. \\xa0Once the server arrived she didn't make a point to say hello, ask how I was doing, etc. \\xa0It was literally just, \"Let me get you a menu.\" \\xa0This was not a busy night, so it wasn't as if she was pressed for time. \\xa0Another 10-15 minutes after bringing the menu, the server finally returned to take my order. \\xa0This time it was nothing except, \"What would you like?\" \\xa0I ordered a drink, at which point I was told they might be out of one of the ingredients. \\xa0Fine...so I chose a glass of wine in the event that was the case. \\xa0She walked away right as I was about to order food. \\xa0Nice. \\xa0Now, you'd think the server would at least let me know one way or the other about the drink, make sure I still wanted the wine instead, etc. \\xa0Nope. \\xa0Without saying one word she dropped the glass of wine on my table several minutes later and walked off. \\xa0I should add the lighting was so awful I couldn't tell the color of my wine. \\xa0It was a rose but looked yellow-ish. No big deal, but it underscores my point re: the decor. \\xa0Eventually the server returned and asked if I needed anything else. \\xa0At the end of the night, once we were ready for the check, all of a sudden the pleasantries and small talk came out. \\xa0Suspicious timing, indeed. \\xa0For one glass of wine, one drink, and one popcorn appetizer the bill was about $45 including tax &amp; tip. \\xa0That's pretty overpriced, even for a nice hotel. \\xa0Were the overall experience more pleasant I would have been able to better justify the money spent. \\xa0<br><br>At the end of the day this was simply Gloria Swanson pretending she was still a big star.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

From the moment we arrived to the time of our late departure I felt better taken care of than just about any hotel I've stayed in. Front desk was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout. We had a ton of stuff that needed to be taken to our room. Alan and the awesome bell staff handled many trips up and down for us, personally offering to help us out at any time during our stay with each trip. The engineering department brought us an HDMI cable and tried to help us troubleshoot our AV issues. The team took care of our trash extremely promptly and maintenance helped us with every request. Housekeeping was very gracious about providing us fresh towels when we asked for a swap out. Often I feel like hotels overcharge every guest for a lot of unnecessary services. In this instance I almost felt I should be paying more to this hotel for all their additional service: everyone was both genuine and welcoming. <br><br>The pool chairs are first come first serve. Not crowded at all during our stay. <br><br>The W is exceptionally well located, just a five minute walk from Target, Ralph's, three different Starbucks and any kind of food you might need to procure at the wealth of great restaurants in Westwood. <br><br>Hard to be too positive about this visit. It's also a popular spot for celebrities and apparently the president?

One of their staff members came over and told me, verbatim, to 'shut up and walk away,' and the night manager nodded in agreement and reiterated the message. <br><br>After I went through the Platinum Concierge to complain, I got an email from their management saying that it was not their fault and the staff member in question was actually a guest, so they were not responsible.<br><br>Let's say that it was a guest who was wearing a crafty imitation of their uniform -- do you really allow your managers to let guests be belligerent to each other while nodding in agreement? <br><br>My favorite part of that response was an invitation to come back and enjoy the hotel again. ...right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

As we walked into our room we were surprised with a bottle of Italian sparkling wine on ice and 4 gorgeous chocolate covered strawberries. Me and the family gobbled down the delectable strawberries, popped the cork and relaxed right away.<br><br>Later that night we went to the outdoors restaurant to enjoy Happy Hour.

Literally no direct damage to the glass. However there is a dent on the A-pillar, which caused a stress fracture in the glass.

Seriously, the TV faces the entrance door / elevator not the bed.<br><br>Called them and requested a new room. I got someone different at reception and they were helpful and moved me. The next room had better layout and this one had a thermostat that was stuck on 65F, which was a lot better, as you could just turn it on for an hour till it got cool, then turn it off for an hour till it got hot again.<br><br>The one thing that was really good was room service. 24 hour room service with some good choices. The blueberry cheesecake at 3am was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful rooms - we got upgraded to a suite with 2 separate bedrooms. I finally got to experience what's it's like to live in 5-6 star apartments albeit for 2 days lol. Everything was impeccable, and even the gym had free ear buds for everyone to use, along w cold towels to cool down, and heaps of BLISS facewipes, individually wrapped (yea I took a few extra ok!). <br><br>I wish they had a SAUNA though (only complaint). Breakfast was phenomenal - I got the breakfast burrito, and even tortilla wrap was scrumptious (usually I throw it away bc it's dry and tasteless). They put some awesome green sauce on it which further added to the spice - heaped with cheese, this definitely made my morning. <br><br>Every day I woke up refreshed bc the sunlight would gently pour in and wake me up (we had a poolside view) so lots of sun shone through. The bed was also super comfy and cozy. Great time here!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I've never been treated with such disdain before in my life.</p>],\n",

(Tito's vodka, pineapple, lemongrass, St. Germain Elderflower liqueur and lemon)<br>The lighting, comfy seats and mood music all add to an atmosphere intended to allow patrons to just chill, relax and enjoy being with friends.</br></br></br></p>,\n",

I'm a huge SPG fan, and this place meets every expectation that I would have for a W. <br><br>First, they recognized my status by giving me a great corner room on a high floor with a good view. Second, the rooms are spacious and modern. I was happy with the Nespresso machine and comfortable bed. Third, the bar is great... They made good cocktails and provided a comfortable spot to relax. Finally, free breakfast with my status at Trace was a great perk. <br><br>I'll be coming back!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

They asked a staff member to show them where they can be picked up since they had made plans to see the city with my sister. <br>Two staff members walked with them, and then waited with them while my sister arrived to pick them up. They even got on my mom's phone to give my sister directions. They chatted and waited until my parents were safe in my sisters car before they returned back inside. <br><br>What an amazing, caring staff. It was totally unexpected. My parents called me to tell me how pleased and how special they made them feel.<br>Thank you W staff for making my parents' first SF trip so memorable! <br><br>Another thing I LOVE about this hotel is their face wash!!!

       "  <p lang=\"en\">Me and my two girlfriends checked in this past Sunday to celebrate a birthday. We were attending a day party on the rooftop lounge. <br>Valet service is confusing as one narrow drive way appears to be only one way however it is for incoming and outgoing vehicle's. The valet drivers dont stand out on the street and hotel entrance in not clearly marked. Parking is outrageous at $60 a night however this is SF! Consider that price when booking your room. <br><br>We arrived at around 130pm and only one room was ready and apparently my friends who booked the rooms were promised a noon check in. We were starving and headed into the onsite restaurant Trace. Menu was limited for lunch and server seemed distracted and unfamiliar with menu..My cheeseburger and fries were good though and my gfs enjoyed thier Caesar salad and sweet potato fries. <br><br>Rooms were basic, and didn't necessarily warrant $300 a night \\xa0 but again we are in SF. <br>Finally we got dressed and ready for the party and we went to order fries, wings, and flat bread from the bar. We were given regular fries instead of sweet potato and \\xa0no plates or assistance setting up the food. We had to serve in take out containers. Not really classy in my opinion. See pictures below. Bar drinks were on point, try the strawberry vodka one which is delicious! I sucked down two back to back! Also our Filipino room concierge was awesome as well. Really a sweetheart!!<br><br>Would i recommend ? Not the restaurant for sure , bar drinks yes , customer service hit or miss. Located in financial district so good for business and easy to get to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">My girlfriend has serious status with and is a big fan of SPG properties. So, for our trip to San Fran she booked the W. I had never been to the one lettered abode before this trip, but the great reviews had me feeling some good vibes.<br><br>The friendly staff welcomed me with warm smiles as I checked in before the GF arrived. The lobby is small but had fresh iced citrus H2o which was a pleasant site and definitely needed after the travels in from SFO. <br><br>The room was in good repair and included a comfortable bed and pillows. As a lot of other reviews, I enjoyed the lighted Buddha. There was also an abundance of dangerously expensive liquor and other goods at your disposal, should you choose to dance with the devil... ha ha ha...<br>Our room location was annoying because it was next to the hotel supply room so during the day time the door was constantly opening and slamming shut. And can't forget about the bathrobe with the really long, random black hair draped across it ... umm how could you miss that when cleaning?<br><br>The first floor bar is open, airy and expensive.<br><br>Anyway it was a good two night stay overall. We would definitely return.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Just what you'd expect the W to be...hip design, party atmosphere, attention to detail and very engaged staff.<br><br>We had a great room on the 29th floor - small (900 sq ft) but well designed, a great view of the Bay Bridge, and a generously sized bathroom. I appreciated the Bliss bath products.<br><br>I see others have posted that the mattress was too firm. I thought the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel room beds I'd slept in. And I didn't find areas where the hotel was \"showing its age\" as described by a fellow Yelper. \\xa0<br><br>Fun Fact - this hotel is about a block away from Yelp's headquarters!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Lots of lovely elements, but some of the decor is a little too groovy for me. <br><br>Let's start with the room. Mine was a fabulous room (no, really, that's the classification of the room) and it was nice. My favorite part was the window seat, which provided a perfect perch for my evening glass of wine and fantastic view of San Francisco. Love that there's a nespresso in the room. Lots of little things that make the room comfy and cozy. But some of the furniture seems cheaply made, which is interesting given the brand and the price per night. <br><br>Being on east coast time totally messes with sleep schedules. I found myself up at 3:30 am with no chance of going back to sleep. \\xa0So I just gave up, got out of bed, had a cup of coffee and hit the gym. What a bizarre gym! It made me feel like I was in a theme park queue. It was bizarre. The good news is that it's a 24 hour gym so people who have trouble sleeping can go wear themselves out in the gym. <br><br>While we were staying at the W, there was a gaming convention just around the corner, and they descended on the hotel bar every evening. If we wanted drinks, we had to go elsewhere. Luckily there's a lot nearby. <br><br>Overall. I enjoyed my stay here, although there are some opportunities to make this a much better hotel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Brett Lucero was awesome!!! \\xa0The service he provided me and did was over the top. \\xa0<br><br>I would of given the hotel 5 stars but I was threatened about having my stuff thrown out because of a computer glitch in their reservation system. \\xa0<br><br>Not sure if it was that \"thinking face\" but Andy told me there was nothing he would do to help. \\xa0 Except give me a late check-out before throwing my stuff into the street. \\xa0<br><br>Luckily Mr. Brett Lucero was willing to talk to management and for $150 more totalling to $590 a night. \\xa0 I was able to stay in the room. \\xa0<br><br>The money was not the issue, the time was not the issue. \\xa0 I hate to believe that I might have actually met someone who might of been racist. \\xa0 <br><br>But if it were not for Andy. \\xa0 I would of given this hotel 5 stars. \\xa0<br><br>If Andy is offended by this review. \\xa0 I apologize. \\xa0But I think the staff needs to give Brett a raise promotion and raise!!! \\xa0And allow him to train Andy on good customer service. \\xa0<br><br>Jos\\xe9 was also helpful in getting my bags up stairs and also he coordinated with the cleaning crew and Brett to have my room serviced. \\xa0<br><br>Anyways I think the W is a good hotel. \\xa0It's expensive and they have lots of amenities. \\xa0They are close to everything and I absolutely love this location. \\xa0 <br><br>My feelings just were very hurt over \"almost\" having my stuff thrown out of the hotel because a guy would not talk to a manager and ask him for help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">The bed. OMG the BED. It was the firmest mattress I've ever had to sleep on. My company really likes the Hyatt Regency Embarcadero which I refuse to stay at because of the firm beds, but this place was way worse. <br><br>I checked in late on Sunday and the staff was pleasant and check in was quick. I like the design of the hotel and I greatly appreciate that they still have room service (great hours too) as more and more hotels are cutting back on this amenity. <br><br>But as soon as I sat down on the bed, I knew I was going to be in for a long three nights. It literally felt like a wood board was under the mattress. When you laid down, there was no sinking in or soft comfort. I'm a side sleeper, so there was an incredible amount of pressure on my hips and shoulders resulting in poor sleep and a lot of pain in the morning. To make it worse, the pillows were some of the softest and fluffiest I've ever felt, so your body had ultra firm support while your head had none. <br><br>It was so miserable, one of my coworkers left a day early to avoid sleeping on that mattress anther night. Will not be staying here again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I had stayed at this hotel about 10 years ago with my co workers. \\xa0It had been the most modern hotel I had seen at the time. \\xa0I had a room looking out to the Golden Gate Bridge - totally amazing. \\xa0I wanted my partner to have a similar experience when we came to San Francisco and spoiled us with a night at the hotel.<br><br>I have traveled quite a bit over the last 10 years and to my disappointment, this hotel is no longer ahead of its years. \\xa0Little to nothing has changed here. \\xa0The biggest disappointment to me was the bathroom - the shower specifically. \\xa0Shower curtains are a thing of the past to me. \\xa0An additional downer was the gym. \\xa0In the pictures it looks amazing. \\xa0I was hoping there'd be windows looking out to SF, but unfortunately you have to run on a treadmill looking at a wall. \\xa0Plus the room is overly air conditioned (probably due to lack of windows). \\xa0Overall, still a fancy hotel - but definitely no longer top of its class and in my opinion, not worth the nightly rates.<br><br>Plus factors: the bed is amazing - we both slept wonderfully and enjoyed our bed. \\xa0The staff is very friendly. \\xa0Free wifi in the rooms was good (once you register as a Starwood member). \\xa0Location of the W is of course great as well - centrally located.<br><br>By the way, if you are coming from SFO and there's at least 2 of you, then a Lyft to this location will cost you about $17-$20. \\xa0<br><br>Hope this review helps others ...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Security to get in here wasn't too strict. They just checked our IDs and tickets and then rushed us inside. There's also coat check available by the restrooms, $5 per coat. The restrooms were clean but shared, so the line got long pretty fast. <br><br>The bar service was pretty quick at the beginning of the night. I was impressed that the drinks were nice and strong and definitely worth the price of the ticket. The dance floors were pretty wide, and each floor had a theme of it's own. I enjoyed the different varieties of music from hip top to edm and just top hits. I had fun on every single floor.<br><br>Towards midnight, the crowd got bigger and the bar was almost impossible to reach but I was already pretty drunk to really care. I also like that we each had champagne flutes for the countdown. Definitely a night to remember, even though I think I slightly blacked out a little, but I had fun so that's all that matters!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The nightclub vibe isn't for everyone upon entering the lobby but I think it's fun and to be expected at this hotel. They email guests in advance to prepare you, which is a nice touch. \\xa0This hotel didn't disappoint. \\xa0<br><br>Check in was smooth and quick and we were upgraded. The room was a decent size for a city hotel and the bed is super comfortable. The bedroom decor has a surprisingly cozy feel with a window seat, lots of white and shutters on the window. \\xa0Bliss products are still there and I love them so I was happy. \\xa0They provide a good variety too, soap, face wash, shower gel, lotion, shampoo and conditioner. Room service was setting champagne in our room as we were checking in (a gift from a friend) so it was a nice touch to have it waiting for us. We were only there one night so didn't get to do too much but I was very satisfied with our stay.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">The W's whole schtick is well embodied at this location: poppin' bar scene, attractive guests and staff, modern rooms, great location. It's properties like this that make the W still the standout of the Starwood Group for younger, hip seeking guests.<br><br>I've had a couple of recent incidences, however, where my reservation was \"given up\"- both times my king room had been booked, and i was assigned a room with only double beds. They've compensated me with bar credit/mini bar credit etc, but sometimes you just want a big bed to crash in.<br><br>Other than that, place is slick and solid.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I have stayed here a couple times. First time was October '15 and then also this past January. <br><br>PARKING:<br>They have valet parking, but no self parking. The valet is $56 plus tax. They do let you know about other non-affiliated parking is available nearby. When I stayed here in October, I had a car, so I needed to find parking. I didn't feel like paying $60, so I parked in the parking garage between the W and the St. Regis, it was half the price and I felt very secure.<br><br>CUSTOMER SERVICE:<br>The employees I've had contact with here have all been very friendly, helpful and accommodating. <br><br>LOBBY/LOUNGE:<br>Their lobby/lounge area is very nice. Definitely has a cool vibe where you would want to hang out in. More of a \"night\" vibe, all day long. Every night I've stayed there, it gets pretty busy at night.<br><br>GYM:<br>The gym is pretty cool. The times I've been, I had no problem being able to use the equipment I wanted. It has a cool, night club vibe as well. They have enough cardio and strength equipment for all your workout needs. They also have free towels for use, apples, ear plugs, sanitary wipes, and magazines for you to read. There are TVs for your viewing as well. <br><br>ROOM:<br>So, this is the part of why I did not give 5 stars. I've stayed in a few 5+ star hotels, and this one just doesn't quite make it. The first time I stayed I helped pay for our room and was shocked at the price for what you got. Yes, I know San Francisco is crazy expensive, but still. The second time I stayed there, it was for work and they paid, but I believe it was much cheaper - they probably had a company discount since they book their employees there often. The first time it was $500, for a basic room. It was nice and definitely not trashy by any means, but still was high. I can go stay at the ritz carlton or st. regis in southern California for that price and sometimes lower. I also felt the walls weren't too thick because I heard the people next to me on both sides every night in the wee hours of the morning. <br><br>Overall, it was a very nice place to stay, but I'm not super anxious to stay there again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Stayed here for my wedding because the wife has always wanted to stay at a W (go figure). \\xa0Overall, it was a bit disappointing. \\xa0The place is getting old and not that well maintained. \\xa0As a few examples, the plastic key-card access panel on the outside of the door to the room fell off when someone passed it. \\xa0The shower bathroom faucet valve came off. \\xa0And the phone worked horribly, to the point where the management came up and then said they would need to replace it. \\xa0<br><br>Also, the service was somewhat lackluster. \\xa0They came to clean up and forgot a few dirty glasses, which were left in plain view on the table. \\xa0If this was a motel, it's what I would expect. \\xa0But from the W, I really expected much better.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">The W Hotel is a nice place to stay in San Francisco. It's very close to the Metreon and Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall.<br><br>The front staff is very friendly and the valet attendants are equally friendly as well as helpful. <br><br>The room is spacious and the bed is fairly comfortable. I enjoy the decor and the glowing Buddha adds a nice touch. Only one side of the room has windows but there's a pretty nice view of the Bay Bridge. <br><br>I particularly like the bathroom. It is very clean and spacious. I like the how the toilet is on the opposite side of the room relative to the bath tub. There are plenty of racks and hooks to hang your towels. <br><br>This is one of my favorite hotels to stay at. There was nothing to complain about. I've been to The Living Room Bar and Lounge on a separate occasion and liked it as well. I definitely recommend checking it out if you're staying at the hotel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>],\n",

(if a convenient gym is important - CALL TO INQUIRE) I didn't have a chance to check out the pool so unsure if one of them is closed but was told the one on the 50th floor is open 8 am - 6 pm.<br><br>Now to my favorite part. I LOVED the room. The decor was really stunning. Beautiful necklaces of jade-colored stones on the walls. Beautiful green lacquered dog/lions on the lamps. The black lattice. A large balcony. Spacious room! A clean tub (to use next time). Green white and black marble all over. And that shower. With excellent water pressure and the waterfall making me never want to get out. If you couldn't tell, I liked it ;)<br><br>Definitely my go to when staying in that area! And look forward to when the renovation work is complete. Thanks for a great and luxurious stay!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">We've run and driven by the W several times and have always wondered about the high-rise hotel, restaurant that features iconic Easter Day Island Head columns. \\xa0Well today was our lucky day and coincidentally National Cheeseburger day!<br><br>We went here for the Yelp Event: Burgers, Beer and Babes. \\xa0For $35 per person we met the creative genius chefs, the \"Burger Babes\", who produced 4 delectably different sliders with a choice of a beer, proving once and for all that the ladies can cook great burgers too! As if there ever was any doubt in my mind. <br><br>We enjoyed these delicious burgers on the 15th floor with spectacular views of the Keys and harbor on a blissfully breezy, clear-skied day. There was also a DJ mixing cover albums for our enjoyment.<br><br>8 sliders was far too much food for two people, and we came prepared, as we hadn't eaten breakfast. <br>My vote for the best slider goes to the vegetarian slider, which was a spicy explosion of flavors in your mouth. \\xa0Due to the diverse flavors, it was by far the best slider. Though we also enjoyed eating the slider on the biscuit bun, which added wholesome heaviness that kept us craving for more! \\xa0 The beer selection at the W was so-so: I had a brown ale by newly opened Taft Brewery which was malty but unremarkable, followed by a Margarita which was very good in its spill proof cup.<br><br>By far the most beautiful babe was sharing my table and I was very thankful for that! This was yet, another fun Yelping event. Glad to have been part of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Will be staying here for my wedding in three weeks and very much looking forward to it. Had some awesome martini drinks at their 15th floor restaurant called Espumita. Had vodka and Cuban coffee in it. My two favorite things! Beautiful views are great but the snooty young kids are not. That's just personal preference though and not the establishment's fault. Valet is $8 an hour and $38 per night. Not bad considering it's trendy Miami.</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">This hotel may end up being amazing, but the incredible attractive pool complex on the 15th floor is now closed and under construction, with a ridiculous dirty parking garage walking detour to get to the Spa / Gym that is unacceptable.<br><br>It seems that all hotel rooms face the street, and the street noise is substantial. \\xa0The rooms are otherwise nice and modern. \\xa0Balcony is great, but overlooks Brickell.<br><br>We used the Priceline Bid Your Own function and paid $200 for a hotel that was showing $550 / night direct booking. \\xa0Also, the Express Deal for the same 5 Star rating in the same area (may have ended up being same hotel) was $257.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Vip for the hotel quests!<br><br>AWESOME*** except that they charged us for the minibar we did not use - they immediately made it correct after complaining. <br>And we had to ask for extra showergel and coffeepads on the next morning..they did not supplied it themselves after housekeeping cleaned the room...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">In need of some time off from work, and a little \"out of the routine\" weekend, my friends and I decided to plan a little staycation in Brickell.<br>We wanted to feel like we were on vacation, with relaxing time by the pool, nice view from our room, good restaurants and bars nearby, and Latin music to dance.<br><br>After some looking around, and quotes, we chose the W Miami.<br>We arrived early on a Friday. \\xa0You can either valet for $38/ night, or park across for (I believe) $24.<br>Our room wasn't ready yet - check in is at 4pm - but they immediately took our luggage and gave us a key to access all their amenities.<br>First thing we did, was checkout the pool. \\xa0Beautiful, long, blue, so relaxing pool. \\xa03ft - 4.6ft deep, perfect for swimming, floating, hanging out or just sunbathing. \\xa0With the room you are entitled to towels and they give you large one for the beds and smaller ones for the chairs.<br>The view from the pool is amazing. \\xa0Water to each side at the end, and airplanes flying by if you look up.<br>Only complaint I have about the pool, is that they don't have any \"pool service\" like drinks, water, etc. \\xa0You have to get up and get it yourself. \\xa0One of the reasons I took one star off.<br>Since we didn't have our room to change into our bathing suits yet, we decided to go to the bar and have some drinks and snacks.<br>But we did take advantage of the pool the rest of our stay.<br><br>On the same floor as the pool they have 15th &amp; vine, where we had champagne mojitos and guacamole.<br>The staff was really friendly, and fast. \\xa0<br><br>By 4pm we should have gotten a call to get our room but it didn't happen.<br>We waited a little over an hour and decided to go down and check. Here's the other reason I took that star off. \\xa0They said they called and kept insisting they did. \\xa0Told them we were in their hotel this whole time and no call was received. \\xa0We explained we had lost over an hour, without our room and luggage, they saw our point and very nicely made it up to us.<br><br>Finally in our room, we were on total vacation mode.<br>Spacious, beautiful, comfortable beds, plenty of mirrors for 3 girls to share, plenty of closet space and drawers, really nice bathroom, with a nice bathtub. <br>It also had a little balcony, perfect for morning coffee, and a beautiful view of the water. \\xa0Everything we had wanted when planning this staycation.<br><br>Very cool thing they do, is they change the rugs on their elevators to match the time of day. \\xa0They have \"Good Morning\", \"Good Afternoon\", and \"Good Evening\" giving their guest a more personal and welcoming feel, each time we walked in or out of the hotel.<br><br>Location is amazing! \\xa0Walking distance from so many delicious restaurants, cafes, and bars. \\xa0<br>We only needed an Uber on our way back one night, after dancing late and feet tired, and the other day to go to Wynwood. \\xa0Everything else we just walked. \\xa0<br><br>Also, other than the initial check in issue, staff was always extremely cordial, professional, and very welcoming.<br><br>Overall this was a wonderful staycation, and part of it was thanks to the beautiful accommodations, pool, and staff from the W Miami. \\xa0Thank you!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">This hotel is nice, but there was a couple pieces of information that concerned me. <br><br>1. They showed pictures of a very large pool on the 15th floor. This pool was closed when we stayed, and they did not bother to let us know. <br><br>2. They charge 15 dollars a night for wifi. For how expensive the rooms are, they should include this.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Good room, plenty of space. \\xa0 Well decorated but the rest of the hotel is not great. \\xa0 The smell is offensive. It's that piped in perfume and it's overwhelming and tacky. \\xa0 The pool is closed for 2 years while they remodel so guests are able to use the residence pool on the 50th floor. \\xa0It is depressing and cheesy. \\xa0 All in all we would not stay here again. \\xa0 It is however, in a location within walking distance of Whole Foods and the MetroMover.<br>It's also loud, due to the traffic on Brickell Ave.</br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Worst hotel EVER. No signs where pool or gym or lounge are. \\xa0Staff is still confused how to get from 50th floor to 15th floor. Residence side is locked access. You need a map like your navigating some haunted house from twilight zone. \\xa0I'm literally stuck in the stairway as I type this!</p>,\n",

His generosity has made our trip much more pleasant! He let us check in \"a little\" early and gave us a great room! Thank you so much max!<br><br>The pool is great and one of the biggest reasons we booked this hotel, highly recommend this hotel if you looking for a relaxing stay. Very close to whole foods and shopping centers.</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Great hotel. Gorgeous room. Generously sized. Comfortable bed. Well appointed with microwave, mini fridge and an illy pod coffee maker. The bathroom is amazing. Separate shower and tub. Large bathroom. Useable balcony.<br>Check in was fantastic. I expected to not be able to get into the room as we took an early plane. However the check in staff was fantastic and got us into a room right away. Asked if we needed late check out. Very pleasant experience.<br>The roof top pool/lounge area is amazing. The views are fantastic, plenty of available around the pool furniture/loungers. 15th and Vine shared the roof top space with the pool. Had a nice $5 happy hour drink special (I had a sparkling wine, he had a local beer, three local beers on tap) and we had the cod fritters which were very good. The bartender was great. Wish I had caught his name. Have USA great recommendations for dinner and nightlife that were perfect for us. <br>Only complaint is we couldn't stay long enough.</br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Surrounded our car to welcome, introduce, and assist us from valet to room. The whole experience has been smooth and flowy, like on a cloud. The inside of every room is beautiful and designed to enlighten the senses of the mind.</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Only reason I am giving a one star is because after questioning my charges of 4 drinks the Wet Deck pool I discovered that the gratuity of 18% was included. Initially the bartender told me the reason my bill was higher was because of the tax. The bartender printed up the itemized receipt after questioning the charges. I pointed out the gratuity and my tax was not what she quoted. The price is not the issue. The issue is that the employee is willing to deceive a customer by omitting the detailed receipt to receive additional tip deceptively. FYI. People don't always remember the price paid but they never forget how they were treated! This problem starts from the top!</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Absolutely superb! Get the bay view and you won't be disappointed. The W is effortless luxury!</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Felix, Director of Style and the whole staff was exceptional! 5 stars for sure!!! I used to frequent this property before \\xa0it converted to The W. While they maintained continuity in the gorgeous grounds and luxurious rooms, the customer service and food is exceptional! <br><br>Even after a small bill discrepancy that was completely my fault, the front desk and Felix took care of it. This continues to be one of my favorite places in the whole world and the people here continue to make it better!</br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">After switching to the w, the quality of service and amenities went way down. \\xa0Security isn't as pleasant. Be prepared to be harassed for smeaking in after signing into the pool, while wearing a wrist band. The pool is run down. There's no cafe or servers anymore. \\xa0And the mail is impossible. If you go during their RIDICULOUS hours, no one's there, \\xa0or there's some excuse as to why they can't walk 3 feet to get your mail. 'Long lunch' 'coffee break' 'it was a holiday 3 days ago' 'there might be a hurricane'. Why post hours at all? Someone spilled oil in the vestibule and i slipped and broke my toes. It was still on the floor hours after i notified them. No longer a destination for me. The one on the beach is way nicer.</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Overcharged me. I've tried to correct this several times. I've called over and over. The manager was supposed to call back but won't. This has been a nightmare.

       " [<p lang=\"en\">Sad to see this was getting such low reviews! We just spent four nights at the W and we were thoroughly impressed. While the hotel was in an older building and the rooms were small, we were so happy with our experience, the prompt and delightful staff, and the cleanliness. We had a quiet room that overlooked the city and a comfortable bed. We had all the amenities we needed within the room and the location was perfect for walking to the Art Institute, Millenium Park and many nearby restaurants. <br><br>The rooms were quiet and private. Shower water was hot, contrary to many reviews, and the Bliss products were fantastic! <br><br>While I wouldn't consider this to be the lap of luxury, it was a perfect place to stay for 4 business nights in Chicago.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">My girlfriend and I booked a trip to Chicago and decided to stay at the W. Its pretty much in the center of ever place we wanted to have meals at. You're also pretty much near every possible fast food and healthcare joint you can think of. That's always a plus. As a side note, almost everything closes at 5pm.<br><br>We arrived at the hotel and began the check in process. We were told that we wouldn't have wifi. I thought that was weird so we asked why? They told us that the \"rate\" with which we had booked with them didn't come with wifi. I assume \"rate\" meant \"you're getting shafted cause you booked through Expedia\". It wasn't the end of the world but it definitely wasn't a pleasant surprise. However, if you join their SPG program, you would get the base amenities. Also, they offer a complimentary hour for those who want to heck out a little later. We were told we could extend it till 1pm, possibly 2pm.<br><br>We get room 811 and get hit with another unpleasant surprise -- our room is pretty much one room from the elevator door and in front of the service elevator. Ok, I get it, the hotel shafts you if you don't book with them directly.<br><br>This is where things pick up slightly. The room was actually larger than I expected. The bathroom was large too. The AC/Heating system was great too (until you try to sleep). Those were the only good things about the room. We drop out stuff down and go out to enjoy Chicago.<br><br>We get back later that night and we're thirsty so we grab the ONE bottle of water that was provided to us in the room. We look at the note on the cap and it says that its complimentary but only if you're an SPG member. Great. So i look around to try to find the coffee pot, thinking we could just boil some tap water, and there isn't one. It wasn't till the last day there that i flipped through one of the many pamphlets they had that said we had to go downstairs for complimentary coffee and/or ask for a coffee pot (which i'm almost certain would require me to pay a higher room premium or be an SPG member).<br><br>I woke up every night because there was some kind of sloshing noise coming from the ventilation system. The weather strip on the door wasn't there so the light from the hallway always came in. I was going to complain but since we were only there for two nights and planned to get up early, i didn't bother. Plus, you know, the whole \"you paid a shitty rate\" vibe.<br><br>For those who are curious about the bathroom, the toilet paper is rough and i'm not sure if the vents even work. I didn't see a fan and, when i looked up, i just saw capped wires. Water pressure and temp from the shower is pretty good. Their lemon sage scented products are nice.<br><br>On the last day, we were coming back from breakfast. Girlfriend went upstairs and I went to use the restroom downstairs. She called the front desk to try to push our check out time one hour since it was complimentary. They only gave her 30 minutes. I wasn't aware that she had called so on my way back up i stopped by the front desk and they told me we could get the full 60. I spoke with my girlfriend and we weren't sure which one to go with so we just left when we were supposed to. <br><br>I know what some are thinking and its that i should've just joined the SPG program. I just didn't want to sign up for another thing that i'd never use and get spammed. To be honest, i feel that if we didn't book through expedia, a lot of this wouldn't have happened. So if you're planning a trip here and see this review, look at some of the others that haven't booked through expedia and see if they experienced the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Not impressed and not up to Starwood standards. \\xa0Booked a night here because the JW across the street was booked. \\xa0 Thank goodness it's just for 1 night. \\xa0The room is tiny and beat to hell. \\xa0The windows are filthy (it's almost May). The TV is so high up on the wall I suggest taking some Aleve before bed as you will most definitely wake up with Neck pain.<br><br>Overall - very disappointing Starwood property. \\xa0I think the W brand once cool is starting to show its age... \\xa0or maybe I am getting too old for the brand?<br><br>The net - if you want a stylish (think 2005 era) hotel that has been beat to hell - this is your place.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Housekeeping was spot on. I loved that I got my soaps and toiletries replenished because I love the bliss brand!<br><br>Breakfast at the hotel was a bit slow, but I did love what was on the menu. Portions were huge, service was slow.<br><br>This is an older hotel that was renovated and seems that it was taken over by the W. had an old building vibe to it. Gym is small and felt crowded with 5 people in there.<br><br>I loved the location as it's a quick walk to the bean, there's a Starbucks around the corner.<br><br>Not the best hotel I've stayed in but I was pretty happy with my stay. I think the branding threw me off a little bit since it was an older hotel. <br><br>I'd say service, cleanliness, and location gives it 4 stars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Ahh. The W City center. Where should I start? Location was pretty great. We had no trouble finding it amongst all the other impressive hotels in the area. When we first walked in I was pretty impressed. If the giant lamps in the \"living room\" (lobby) don't catch your eye, the sleek bar immediately to your left as you walk in does. Anything positive to say ends there. An outrageous $200 incidentals hold(more expensive hotels on the same street are around $50). Tiny rooms with tinier beds that they think they can dress up with the modern art/style that threw up all over the room. $25 wifi, outdated Diet Coke in the mini bar and The walls are paper thin. I knew the names, flight times and whether they prefer it completely dark or a little light to sleep of our closest neighbors. (And that was after security shut down their party). \\xa0Speaking of that. Called the front desk at midnight to make them aware of the excessive noise( it was 6 people partying before their flight). Was told they would send someone up immediately. Waited 45 minutes and they were still going strong, we somehow managed to pass out anyways. Woke up at 4 am, and wouldn't you know it they were still going strong. So, went down and told the front desk. 10 minutes later security came up and removed all but 2 people in the room because they have had 4-5 complaints ( I was 2/5)throughout the night. I asked the manager about their noise policy the next morning and she proceeded to give me a rehearsed speech. 3 strikes and they're out essentially. 3 strikes... not 5. Or 4.5 hours. Not once did she apologize or acknowledge a problem. Only defend their policy. Do not. I repeat. DO NOT STAY AT THE W CITY CENTER.</p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Not impressed. <br><br>We stayed here as part of our vacation package through American Airlines. Rooms are small, bathrooms tiny. Soundproofing pretty much non-existent, if you are unlucky to get a street facing room.<br><br>Oh, and we were told breakfast was included in our package. Guess what, it actually was a to-go box with stale pastries, an apple each and bottle of orange juice. We just went to a nearby bakery. Even a Best Western offers better breakfast. American Airlines needs to better vet the hotels they allow in their vacation deals. <br><br>While most non-front desk staff was friendly, our brief experience with the downstairs IPO Restaurant seating lady was enough to avoid it during our stay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">I'd expected The W - City Center to be far more ritzy and impressive than the Lakeshore location, and in some regards it was but I have to say that I'd prefer to stay at The W - Lakeshore than this location. \\xa0My first impressions of this hotel was formed when walking into the lobby, which at first glance seemed spectacular. \\xa0However, I began to see how tattered the furniture was in the lobby and to be honest, I was shocked that the hotel hadn't maintained this better. \\xa0Regardless, the layout of the lobby was interesting, but I think I'd still prefer the open layout of the other location.<br><br>I should also mention that the staff whom are responsible for greeting and checking people in/out are rude. \\xa0Rude beyond belief - they need a refresher course on what it means to provide good customer service. \\xa0I'd taken up so many issues with the hotel at this point, and I hadn't even walked up to the room yet. \\xa0And while I'm on this discourse, I'll also mention that the bar area at this location is anything but enthusing...it's right by the door so when it's cold and people are coming in and out it can be difficult to sit and relax a drink.<br><br>The room itself was nice, and I actually preferred it over the Lakeshore location. \\xa0The pure fact that this hotel has a Freudian couch in its room is the greatest thing ever...especially for the psychologists and counselors like myself and fiance. \\xa0Secondly, the bed itself was quite the comfy one there were several outlets placed conveniently by the bed...that's some good engineering. \\xa0Thirdly, and perhaps my favorite thing, is that the shower head was tall! \\xa0I'm a tall lady and I HATE when I have to be contortionist in hotel showers just to wish my hair...that wasn't the case here! \\xa0And, the complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body soap was AWESOME. \\xa0I got out of the shower yelling to my fiance: \"I smell like the colors of the rainbow!!!\"<br><br>Now, had it not been for the free SPG points this room would have been crazy expensive at around $400 per night. \\xa0And, it didn't even have a great view as the Lakeshore location did of Navy Pier. \\xa0Instead, when looking out the window you saw the lovely construction workers below. \\xa0Speaking of which, there is an excess of construction going on immediately around the hotel, making it difficult to access by car.<br><br>On the other hand, it's very close to some of the CTA stops which makes it conveniently located in that sense. \\xa0One last thing, my fiance and I found that when looking for food around 9 or 10 pm, many of the restaurant right around here were closed...so if you're someone who wants food after \"typical\" hours, this hotel isn't for you...also, don't waste your money on the food service in the hotel - it's ridiculously over-priced... $20 for a breakfast burrito? \\xa0I think not.<br><br>I thought the hotel was fine, but I've been to others that I have enjoyed more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Pretty disappointing.<br><br>First, the elevators are dark and have a blurry faux-3D wall covering thing going on. It looks like how you'd see the world when you were 12 beers into a hard night. I don't really understand how anyone could take being in them if they were *actually* 12 beers into a hard night, yet that's the type of crowd that the hotel seems to be catering to!<br><br>The room was really tiny, like doors hitting other doors, no room to maneuver tiny.<br><br>It was relatively clean which was good, it just wasn't *good*. It was like someone had thrown every cliche thing at it without any filtering.<br><br>You can do a lot better elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       "  <p lang=\"en\">Should have read the reviews before booking for a work trip. At $400/night, I expected WAY more. My coworkers who stayed at La Quinta sounded like they had a 1000% better experience than me. <br><br>The rooms are fairly small. This wasn't a huge deal for me because I didn't plan on staying in my room much, but it could definitely feel cramped for some. The bathroom was TINY - no shelf space at all and the only saving grace was having Bliss toiletries for free. <br><br>The A/C fan inside and train outside can be loud if you are a light sleeper. I am from NYC so it wasn't a huge deal (just like the small space). However, the dealbreaker was the LACK OF HOT WATER when I took a shower - BOTH NIGHTS!!! On the first night, I thought perhaps I had just gotten back too late and they ran out of hot water... which is actually still ridiculous for a hotel. However, when it happened again on the second night, I went downstairs to inquire. <br><br>They said they could send an engineer, with no estimate on time (it was already midnight, so I didn't bother). There was no mention of a potential room switch - although they *were* fully booked, they say. <br><br>The luggage storage also takes forever, they will page for an \"ambassador\" who shows up 10 minutes later when it would be faster just to retrieve myself. <br><br>Needless to say, I will not be staying at a W Hotel, ANYWHERE, again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

(Room #1919)<br><br>Only draw back and this is a big one! \\xa0The metro train you hear every few minutes, so if you're a light sleeper...this is not the room for you!<br><br>After a few drinx and some amazing food at \"The Purple Pig\" I didn't hear much of the trains...<br><br>The Real Traveler (Snob)<br>Just keepin' it real</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

They also provide a plethora of toiletries (I don't know about you but in my experience it's hit or miss with the toiletries options at hotels these days - from high end to budget stays) - face wash, shampoo and conditioner, body butter, lemon grass soap, etc. <br><br>The staff were very professional, courteous and prompt. Checkin and checkout was an absolute breeze. <br><br>My favorite thing is that they're so central to so much - corner bakery (one of my favorite places), 7-eleven, Walgreens, and a wide variety of other places; not to mention the Shops on State street is within a few breezy blocks (use your Google maps app - less than 10 minutes walk). Cant go wrong with this location as far as I'm concerned. <br><br>In addition to foregoing, there's also a full bar, lounge and restaurant on the first floor. It looked pretty poppington to me.

Long line to check in with only 1 person at the front desk. <br><br>2. \\xa0Requested high room AWAY from elevator, received low room ACROSS from elevator. Also noted we were celebrating a Birthday in our reservation and nothing was done at all. Not even a \"Happy Birthday\" upon arrival. Why ask? <br><br>3. Arrived to a shockingly small room to find little black hairs all over the white bed, a strange odor in the room.<br> \\xa0Called down to switch rooms and promptly told the hotel was OVERsold and we couldn't be accommodated. \\xa0Returned to long line at front desk for 15 more minutes of negotiation until we were finally offered a room on the same low floor but a little further from the elevator. <br><br>4. Walk in to new room and am shocked that this room feels even smaller. We can hear the L train go by. Bathroom was obnoxiously small. \\xa0No counter space, the sink honestly resembled the small metal ones you see in campers. \\xa0No space in room for personal items. Bathtub was half the size of standard tub with shower. Toilet was wedged between the sink and wall, barely enough space to sit. Exhaust fan did not work and was caked in dust. \\xa0(Warning if you have allergies!)<br><br>5. Fully stocked fridge in room with outrageous prices (Coke $4, M&amp;Ms $10!). \\xa0We brought our own drinks, but if we want them cool (for the WEEK we were staying there) we were told we could not remove anything from the fridge, instead we must request a 2nd fridge to be delivered to the tiny room. So I'm standing in this room where space is at a premium staring at TWO side by side refrigerators wondering how on earth this makes sense.<br><br>6. Beware of your linens. Our mattress and sheets were disgusting. \\xa0I move the sheets to check for bed bugs because at this point I am not impressed with the cleanliness of this room and find huge stains on the mattress and on the pillow cases. \\xa0Gross! I'll add pictures if Yelp will let me. <br><br>Now let's talk about those \"extra\" charges that add up. \\xa0EVERYTHING in this hotel is an extra charge. For example we needed to print an email and were shocked to see credit card sliders attached to the computers in the business center $7.95 for 15 minutes of Internet. Oh and you want to print? \\xa0 Be sure to check those print settings! $.40 for each B&amp;W \\xa0page and $1.00 for each color page. Mind you I am staying with a corporate account (and a large one at that!) <br><br>Coffee in room? Nope. Shower cap? Nope. But they did have a useless glass paperweight and a lit up sign in the room that served no purpose other than replace what could have been usable cabinet space. <br><br>AlI &amp; all I expect more for $392.12 a night. We won't be back.<br><br>Update: \\xa0Just received our final bill and they charged the wrong card, even after I reiterated which card with the front desk. <br><br>Update #2: I have left TWO messages for the accounting department, both unanswered. \\xa0I am now emailing them to get resolution. The customer service at this hotel is horrible. <br><br>If I could award zero stars I would. What a miserable experience for nearly $2000.<br><br>Go anywhere else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The AV team was top-notch as well - they were able to get everything set up in record time and were at our beck and call when we needed them.<br><br>Rooms themselves are kind of tiny, but it's not like you're going to spend tons of time there anyway.

       " <p lang=\"en\">I was super impressed with my stay at the W. There are a lot of mixed reviews here but let me tell you first hand being a very picky person, you shouldn't rule this hotel out. First let's start with the basics. It is pricy but that is normal for NYC and the area you are in. After spending 5 days here I can understand why. You are practically in walking distance to everything and only a short subway ride from the West Village, Soho, TriBeCa and Brooklyn or NJ. Convenience of that cannot be matched.<br><br>Next up the condition of the hotel, it is going through a renovation. I knew this beforehand so I called to inquire since I wasn't notified at booking. For the inconvenience we were upgraded to a high floor with a $100 credit. The rooms and hallways are nice just worn. The hotel isn't 5 years old and it shows but it's not a Motel 6 by any means and from what I can tell with the latest updates to the Living Room Bar (which is very nice btw) the rooms and hallways should be in great condition very soon! The beds were super comfy. The sinks and shower heads were modern with adequate pressure and we didn't feel short on towed. Storage is at a minimum like anything else in the city but we managed.<br><br>Now the staff, I found the concierge, bell boys, wait staff and administrative team to be very helpful. They are young so you may have to ask for certain things but they comply immediately without complaint. Our bags were taken care of our rooms were always refreshed daily and we got a complimentary bottle of water and Bliss Products to use daily. Lastly, their team checked in with us via email prior to our checkout and ended up crediting us our Living Room charges due to our room not being ready upon check in! Again they surprised me and were fabulous! <br><br>Overall, I'd have to say I feel pleased with our stay. We experienced the bar, room services, their super nice gym (with a separate room for free weights and stretching), free wifi, and great bell boys along with excellent directions and suggestions from the concierge. I highly recommend this property to those coming to the city for the first time or planning for a lot of action in the theatre district, Rockerfeller Center, NBC or ABC studios, the shopping, Central and Bryant Park and more! I would definitely come back!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Looked good on the website, but, eh not impressed. Close to Times Square, so they know they have a cash cow.<br>No microwave, no coffee maker, the only fridge was a mini bar stocked to capacity with way overpriced drinks (Glad we brought a cooler), no breakfast, etc. the mini can of Pringles potato chips was $9.<br>We stayed at The Element last year for $25 more, and it was a thousand times better.<br>Avoid.</br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">A solid 3 stars, and maybe 3.5 if I could give them that rating. But I can't. So...3...<br><br>The hotel is right in the very heart of the beast--New York's Times Square, full of hucksters wanting to give you tours, restaurants that people have in their malls back home (change is hard...), and all the lights and all the pedestrians. It's a ridiculous part of the city, but worth seeing if you don't live in or near or anywhere within 100 miles of New York. We were there at the most ridiculous time too, during the holidays. <br><br>We made the poor choice to drive into the city rather than take the train from Connecticut. Turning on 47th street took (no hyperbole) half an hour because of the sea of pedestrians. To turn the corner. <br><br>That's not W's fault, but they know how to bleed you. $65 for valet parking overnight. But heck, you'll pay nearly that much at a local garage.<br><br>The hotel itself--for New York, so it's all relative--is not too shabby. It could use an upgrade eventually, but it's a good 5 on a scale of 1-10 for modern and clean. This is true of the rooms, too--ours was nice enough but showed wear and tear along the floor and a little staining. <br><br>We had a very high floor, right near the top (57th) and the view was nice but not remarkable (it was a \"Hudson view\" obscured by the angle of the corner room). You are very high up, which makes what is probably intolerable traffic noise tolerable. The room itself is small but not at all tiny (again by NYC standards)<br><br>The bed was fine, again nothing to write home about. But the bathroom... They have the strangest frosted glass side to the en suite so you can well see the outline of the person sitting on the pot. I don't know about you, but I like my privacy, even with loved ones, and I didn't appreciate that at all. The toilet was a little broken, too. All and all meh in that department.<br><br>The staff was nice and courteous, and they took care of me as an SPG Gold member. We had a concert to go to around Lincoln Center and got a decent rate here, even though it was astronomically expensive ($484!) for this time of year in New York that can be what youre paying for something decent.<br><br>We didn't try the mobile system for the door, but I like the idea well enough. How often do I demagnetize those darn things!<br><br>So all and all a decent experience but probably won't be repeated given the location and state of it all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This hotel is pretty good as far as Ws in tourist locations are concerned. \\xa0Really don't like the location, but can't exactly criticize it since you know what you get when you sign up for staying at Times Sq. <br><br>Rooms are medium-sized for Manhattan, I'd say. Probably smaller than the W Union Sq., but larger than the W New York (I may have been upgraded to different rooms each time, but as a Platinum guest, I usually end up with around the same level of room). During one of my stays, they told me they were going to put me in a large room, and I said that I usually prefer a better view to room size, so they gave me a room with a view of Broadway -- it was pretty cool.<br><br>I had room service a of times, and it was quite good. <br><br>My stays here have been quite uneventful, which is probably a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Not only did we have a beautiful view we had a corner room that had 2 different views one view was of the Hudson River and the other view was of time square. The room was perfect besides one little thing. For a room listed for 500$ a night you would expected to have a scratched up head board :/ but other than that loved the stay. I would recommend this place in a heart beat!!!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Doesn't meet the standards of a typical W. I am a business traveler, so very particular, which is why I try to stay at Ws. Here are issues:<br><br>1. Walls are thin. I have been woken up by neighbors 3x. The Times Square noise \\xa0is to be expected, but I shouldn't hear my neighbors as much as I am.<br><br>2. \\xa0The gym is subpar. The weight room has space for 1 person to lie down on a mat, that's it. Empty another hotel room and make a bigger space. You have a million weights and mats, yet no space for any of it. <br><br>3. No coffee in the mornings, you have to \\xa0go to Starbucks. Every. Single. W I go to has free coffee. Maybe I don't want to go outside to a times square starbucks in freezing weather...<br><br>4. Room service is fast (unless they forget you), but soooo expensive. And again. I stay at Ws pretty frequently. And they never include water with it! I would expect a glass of water with \\xa0my meal I paid out the nose for.<br><br>5. As others have mentioned, why is the door on the bathroom frosted? Also, the door to the shower opens away from the spout, so to turn on the water, you have no choice but to get wet. Everyone loves a burst of cold water when getting into the shower...<br><br>There are some good \\xa0things, staff is very nice and the rooms are cute and large for NYC, But ultimately it's just not up to par, and I am probably going to switch to the Marriott. Also, fellow platinum SPGers, the upgrades don't seem to happen here as often as other places, but maybe that's just Times Square.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

They were under renovations (July 2015) so the bar was closed, and the lobby was boarded up. I thought the room would be more decorated but again it was just ok. The best thing about the room was the \"Bliss\" products they provided....facial and body wash, shampoo, and conditioner! <br><br>Noise from traffic downstairs was constant, even 30 floors high, but I got used to it. The refrigerator was useless, unless you were gonna raid the controlled bar products which filled it. Urrrrrr<br><br>Nice gym! Worked out only once. Who works out in New York, right? Anyway, there is a gym and it's cool. <br><br>Blue fin restaurant and bar downstairs was good. We had a $100 credit there so we used it for pre-dinner drinks. Great deal!<br><br>The staff at the hotel was wonderful. From the bellman outside to the woman working the front desk, everyone was professional and accommodating.

We were upgraded to a suite, Pamela, the W insider left us a nice personal note along with a mug and a fridge magnet to commemorate our going to see wicked that night. I could not log onto the business center to print my tickets, I was disappointed to find out that they charged for it but nevertheless attempted unsuccessfully to utilize it. Ultimately, they were kind enough to let me email the tickets to an email address and they printed them out for me. What I determined in that process, that there was a gentleman in the checking in process who treated us rather coldly. I wasn't sure if \\xa0it was in my head until I had the business center issues and the checkout the \\xa0next day. He wasn't overtly rude, but unquestionably cold. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars, the location was awesome, the service was awesome and the personal touch by Pamela knocked our socks off.

I recently went to a conference and needed somewhere near Times Square to stay. In search of more Starwood points, I decided to go ahead and book the W again. My last visit, I found it noisy and outdated. This time, I noticed the furniture seemed updated but as a business traveler, there were some big missteps:<br><br>1. No outlets near the bed.<br>2. Nobody could figure out how to make the remote printing services that they offer in the guest handbook work. It was crucial that I printed out a deck before the conference I was speaking at, I used the remote wireless printing service, obtained a printing code and then went to the business center only to find out that that's not where you get your prints from. Really? Why isn't that in the guest handbook? Then I went down to the concierge, only for them to tell me that they couldn't find my prints. It was an absolute disaster and they shouldn't promise services to guests that are not a. Clearly defined and b. Easy to follow. <br>3.

As usual, there were no nicer rooms to be upgraded to. I'm staring to figure this is just an illusional SPG perk. <br><br>Once you figure out how to navigate the multiple elevators, it's easy. \\xa0As soon as I entered the room I was hit was a water, moldy smell. The shower curtain either isn't cleaned as often as it should (with bleach) or the tile is just lacking better cleaning! I had two beds room on 40th floor, which were full size beds vice queen beds, not convenient, but still comfortable. Unfortunately, the hotel brand is failing to notice some rooms furniture is worn out, the bed headboards are banged up from use (tears). This is disappointing and certainly cheapens the brand for me. I'll have to reconsider other W hotels at main cities by checking Yelp in the future. I never had to, because usually the brand is on point! I'd rather stay at a cheaper or lower star SPG hotel if this is what I'd have to expect, than pay for the 5-6 stars a W usually comes in as. <br><br>Never had key issues, which is great, nothing worse than a key getting demagnetized or just fluking out on you. <br><br>The lobby bar is cozy and chill. The service was great here too and music is typical for W standards. <br><br>I was able to visit Izi sushi restaurant. Fresh sushi and wide selection of Japanese whiskies. Customer service and knowledge of whisky is noted! I was surprised to hear I would not receive the discount I was told I would get for dinning at W restaurant. SPG should update their hotel amenities online. <br><br>Service and convenience happens to be important to me. The hotel overall was very conveniently located within steps to Times Square activity, across from a Starbucks, down the street from Copacabana and other fun bars, and the service brought me to the 3 star rating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I don't care what the \"theme\" of your hipster cool person hotel is, that's ridiculous. I don't want to start my stay, not even at some urban trendy joint, by having a shouting match. Rooms are also very dim, which I suppose is part of the hip vibe, and the vanity in my hotel room, while again fashionable, provided almost no room to set out toiletries.

Every time I go I make sure to ask Johnathon the bartender for an old fashioned. Nothing short of great, this Is the place for all social purposes. If it is a meeting or a social gathering this hotel can accommodate. I like their booths which are secluded yet immersive in the nightlife experience. I over heard that they are trying to build their venue into a nightlife experience so when that happens it's sure to be fun. They do have tons of events from what I see occurring at their venue so if you want the know how just follow them on Instagram. My favorite would be their new program Broadway at the W.

So we ended up paying $40 for a bagel with salmon and granola for breakfast! \\xa0But hey, we got free coffee! :( \\xa0We didn't bother going for the 'continental breakfast' the rest of the mornings.<br><br>Room Service: Later one evening at about 8 pm, we ordered a bowl of berries and a sliced fruit platter via in-room dining. \\xa0The order was delivered in 20 minutes. \\xa0After we got about half way through the fruit, we found an extremely moldy blackberry right in the middle of the fruit. \\xa0GAG. \\xa0So much for rinsing and picking your fruit, much less checking to make sure it's not moldy.<br><br>Check-out: This was by far the most confusing part of the stay. \\xa0The morning of checkout, I was called and emailed that my American Express Starwood credit card was being declined for the final bill. \\xa0Confused, I looked at my online account and found that I had only $500 in available credit, when I should have had at least $2500 available, more than enough to cover the $1800 total bill. \\xa0I looked further at my account and saw an 'authorization' for $1500 on check-in day, another for $189 the following day, and another $380 on the next day - all from the W Hotel. \\xa0I walked down to the front desk and inquired about this and they said I owed $1890 for my stay and that my credit card was declined for that amount. \\xa0I told the front desk attendant that they had already authorized my card for \\xa0more than that amount. \\xa0Her response was: oh those are not charges, they are just authorizations so that doesn't matter.....so just provide them with another form of payment... WTF, Over? \\xa0After a few more minutes of arguing that I wanted to keep my stay on my SPG card for the bonus points I receive for using it at Starwood properties, she rolled her eyes and said, \"let me get the manager.\" \\xa0She returned after about five minutes and said the manager took care of it and pushed the authorizations to charge on my CC. \\xa0\"Thank You, see you again soon.\" \\xa0WOW. <br><br>Never again will I waste my money at this property. \\xa0Even with a suite upgrade, it was not worth $350 a night for the lack of quality and service that any W Hotel should be ashamed of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Please do not come! This hotel doesn't worth it! We asked to change the room because it was next to the elevator and they told us they will give us a new room tomorrow(time: 1:30pm). In the next day, we went to the front dest to double checked it before we left(10:00am), another guy said he couldn't see any note in his computer record. Anyway, they made the note. In the evening, we came back(5:00pm), no any room is ready. We need to go back to our old room and wait! Unbelievable service! <br> <br>Room was very old, they should be remodeled \\xa010years ago!</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Poor management. I'm an SPG Gold Member and that means nothing here.<br><br>I booked a Marvelous suite \\xa0which I could have paid $330 for on my SPG account but \\xa0there was an option to pay $120 extra for an \"Guaranteed Upgrade\" on the SPG online website. <br><br>I've stayed at MANY W Hotel's before and TIMES SQUARE is by far, the WORST! (management wise)<br><br>If you are an SPG Gold Member, you know that you are entitled to a free upgrade if available, but for a place like Times Square, I figured I should pay the extra fee of $120 to get the guaranteed upgrade since I had friends coming from Rhode Island to visit the big apple. <br><br>When we all arrived and I went to the counter, my upgrade wasn't mentioned at all. When I inquired about the upgrade that I paid extra for, the front desk associate said she had to get a manager. <br><br>When the manager came out 1 minute later, she went to the computer and said I booked the \"fantastic suite\" and they upgraded me to the \"Marvelous suite\". The manager spoke to me like I was stupid and like i was trying to get something for free, as if I was a problem guest. At this point, although I knew what I booked, I started to feel embarrassed because other guests were on line to check-in and other guest to my left checking in, also hearing everything that was going on. I started to feel hot and started sweating, feeling embarrassed because of how I was being treated. <br><br>I RESPECTFULLY told the manager that I booked the 'Marvelous suite\" and proved same to her by showing her the email that I received which stated \"MARVELOUS SUITE\" and also \"GUARANTEED UPGRADE\". She then went on to say that she sees that now but they don't have any upgrades available and she cannot issue a refund because her system shows that I paid the correct price for the \"MARVELOUS SUITE\" and that the \"GUARANTEED UPGRADE\" does NOT mean you're getting a guaranteed upgrade, it's only based on availability and she sarcastically said \"thank you\" and walked in the back room.<br><br>SO Moral of the story is that Management at the W hotel makes up their own rules and really DON'T care about their guests. I didn't argue with the front desk rep, I respectfully took my room key and just stayed in the room that I now paid $450 for when I could have paid $330.<br><br>I DID NOT GET A REFUND NOR DID I GET AN UPGRADE!<br><br>NEVER GOING TO STAY HERE AGAIN! <br><br>NYC has 4 W Hotels, I advise you stay at another location like the one on Lexington Ave with amazing customer service!!<br><br>I have a picture of the email confirmation that states\" Marvelous Suite\" and \"Guaranteed Upgrade\" in Bold Black letters to anyone who would like to see it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The location will not disappoint; positioned right in Times Square, in the heart of the theater district! There are numerous landmarks, restaurants and shops right outside the door and within a short walking distance. You're also a skip away from the famous Ball Drop!<br><br>The entrance into the W hotel is breathtaking. You walk in to a tranquil room surrounded by glass with a gorgeous body of water running through the ceiling and walls. As you wait for the elevator to bring you up to the 7th floor (lobby) to check in, the sound of the dramatic water feature is extremely revitalizing and an unexpected getaway from the wild streets of Times Square right outside the doors. Parts of the lobby were super swanky and sexy with a luxurious lobby bar with geometric shaped pods for private seating, but I felt that they took major short-cuts on the rooms -minimalist and cheap. The pink accents scattered about the room were a bit of an eye sore, the window chaise lounge wasn't comfortable or pleasing to look at, and the extra dingy hallways smelled like old food.<br><br>We were situated on the 12th floor with a corner \"Fabulous\" king suite and (not-so) Times Square view. Unfortunately we were not high enough to enjoy the view of Times Square - we looked directly out into the backs of all of the marquees and banners on Times Square. Although the view was a major bummer, it didn't upset us too much since we were out walking the streets of New York and exploring the local flavor our entire stay. If a view is something you call for - the 26+ floors should do just fine.<br> <br>I was obsessed with the complimentary BLISS products: lotion, shampoo, conditioner, soap, face and body wash all in the most fabulously invigorating sage &amp; lemon scent! You know we requested refills for each day and the front desk obliged and supplied us with more than we could ask for (score!) I can appreciate the spa-like bathroom design; the modern floating sink with a waterfall faucet was extremely sleek. However, there were a few issues with the bathroom that I must mention: The waterfall spa shower was beautiful, but the water pressure was atrocious - I felt that my shower time was extended by at least 15 minutes due to how weak the water came out. Also the towels were tiny and abrasive. The pillows were useless and flattened out completely - although they deliver extra pillows if you require it, they were still too weak to support the weight of my head. However, the highlight of my slumber was the W signature bed with 350-thread count sheets! So super soft and comfy; the bed and sheets helped me rest like a baby. Keep in mind, being in the action means also sleeping in the action. The noise from taxi horns and shenanigans on the streets were steady all night long - I got used to it though.<br><br>There are slim dining options offered at this hotel, however, the hotel's restaurant Blue Fin is located downstairs and was surprisingly delicious. We decided on dinner here as it was convenient and because we were offered a generous $100 dining credit due to our delayed flight causing us to miss a day of stay - we tried the seafood tower which was filling and a selection of house specialty nigiri. I highly recommend the fresh nigiri and sushi options - the fish was fresh and buttery!<br><br>The W had a lot of promise but the staff here are far from Las Vegas hospitality - they aren't as accommodating or charismatic. There was no doorman to open the door for guests, the bell-man was non-existent, and the concierge were not easy to approach. We were supposed to have our bags pulled from our room on our departure day, but that didn't happen, leaving an unnecessary commotion in the lobby to make us almost late to the airport for our flight. These mishaps left a sour memory of this property, but convenience is key and this hotel delivers easy access to the action.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've stayed at several different hotels in Manhattan. \\xa0I am never disappointed when I stay at the W. \\xa0It is definitely my favorite. \\xa0The customer service is excellent. \\xa0They have the friendliest people working at the front desk who are instantly responsive to their guests.<br><br>The location is perfect- right in Times Square. \\xa0It is within walking distance of countless landmarks, restaurants and shops. \\xa0The rooms themselves are beautifully decorated. \\xa0I love the modern theme.<br><br>The lobby is beautiful, filled with modern art and decorative light fixtures. \\xa0They even have a DJ playing music on Friday and Saturday nights. \\xa0The entrance has falling water behind glass as its ceiling and walls. \\xa0It is attached to a Blue Fin sushi restaurant, which has an excellent brunch.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So let's start by saying the staff is amazing. Everyone, my family of four, have encountered has been sensational. Kept asking myself what the W standard was. I have stayed at W's all over the country and this...I know, I know in Times Square version is most definitely less than standard. The room despite being upgraded was small and thoroughly beaten up...but that's not why I give it one star. The one star comes from the booger that has also been a guest since check in. It's on the ceiling so it may be hard to reach! Lol. Still if it was just a booger I would still put the room at two stars. Today we woke to no hot water. As a matter of fact I'm writing this while on the toilet waiting to muster enough courage to jump in the frigid water for ten seconds! Great service, horrible room.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is a great hotel, but I had a problem with the bathrooms. The walls and door are see-through, so you can see into the bathroom when the lights are on. <br><br>I was staying with my boyfriend so it wasn't a big deal, but if I was staying with anyone else it would have been a problem.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Terrible customer service. I called the hotel to ask if I could upgrade my room for my reservation next month (you'd think the offer to spend more money would get decent service right? Wrong.). The first person I spoke to was very confused about what I wanted but eventually transferred me to 'Room Services'. The phone just rang for five minutes. Occasionally someone would pick up, transfer the call immediately without saying anything, and it would continue ringing. Eventually the first lady picked up again and said that they were all away from their desks. This was at 11AM ET by the way. She said they would call me back as soon as they returned.<br>Apparently they haven't yet returned because I have yet to receive a call. I am now somewhat dreading actually staying there if this is the kind of service I can look forward to.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">How to call W hotel, service is poor and room<br>Temperature cannot solve for 2days.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I was excited to stay at this hotel as I've stayed at other W locations and have been pleased. <br>Lobby should have a sign indicating you need to take the elevator to the 7th floor to check in. There's a reception area that's always empty. <br>Pleasant check in although our room wasn't upgraded and no mention of SPG Gold members which should also have an upgrade. <br>56th floor. Outdated dirty room directly in front of the elevators. Thin walls-heard everybody coming and going. The room smelled moldy and felt that way. The air conditioner didn't work well at all. The window shade was broken and ripped and we looked directly into another hotel. The headboard was all scratched up. The extremely small bathroom had hair on the floor, multiple stains on the ceiling and sludge in the shower corner/walls. <br>When we went down to ask about our upgrade and VIP she said it was already upgraded. She gave us 2 drink coupons for the bar. <br>The upside to this hotel is the proximity to Times Square, the lobby bar Friday night, the Bliss products and the Mexican restaurant downstairs. <br>There are better hotels for the price. As a side note, I filled out their questionnaire after our stay pointing out these concerns and never heard back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My wife and I just stayed here this past weekend when we came back to visit New York since our move west. \\xa0We LOVED this hotel. \\xa0I have stayed at several W's during my business travels and they have always been high quality and top notch but this W takes the cake! \\xa0It was one of my best experiences I have ever had traveling.<br><br>First, of all they were so incredibly helpful in providing us a crib for our new baby daughter. \\xa0They brought it up to the room immediately when we arrived which was great. \\xa0Second, they gave us a free onesie for our daughter that says W Hotels on the front and on the back, on the butt it says \"W-oops.\" \\xa0It is really cute and I can't wait to put her in it when she gets a little bigger.<br><br>They also gave us a nice card congratulating us on the arrival of our daughter and letting us know if there is anything else they can do to make our stay comfortable to not hesitate to let them know. \\xa0Shortly after we received the card and the onesie, someone from hospitality came up and gave us a plate of chocolate covered strawberries. \\xa0It was so awesome.<br><br>During our stay we also made several additional requests such as additional pillows, towels and supplies. \\xa0They were delivered to our room easily within 15 minutes and sometimes within 5. \\xa0It was really great. \\xa0They also do have free Wi-Fi in case you care and for $10 you can upgrade to a higher bandwidth if needed.<br><br>Finally, it was great they have an on-call doctor and dentist at this hotel. \\xa0My wife injured herself during our trip and couldn't really walk at all on Saturday so \\xa0I called the \"Wherever/Whenever\" team and to my shock they had a Dr who could come by and check out her knee. \\xa0Now it wasn't free of course but it was great to have and it was very helpful. \\xa0Not only that but the Dr they have on call has some serious credentials to his name and did a great job with my wife.<br><br>Everyone from the front desk, to the guys downstairs and the staff were just so great and so helpful. \\xa0It made our stay so much more wonderful than it already was. \\xa0We will for sure be staying here on future trips to NYC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The hotel itself is in a great location adjacent to Times Square. The rooms are nice, If small -- at least by non-NY standards. <br><br>Why just two stars? \\xa0The hotel doesn't seem to be staffed to handle the volume that it's location brings. My room was not ready at the stated check-in time or even the much belays time the front desk promised me. The front desk told me that they would call the bell desk to have my bags brought up. We waited and waited and waited. We called down, and were told the bags were on their way. We waited some more. We called down again to learn that our bags actually *weren't* on thee way because the front desk would have needed our claim tickets to send the bags up. Obviously, the agent at the front desk should have known that in the first instance. And she must have realized at some point that she had failed to ask for the tickets, but she took no steps to contact us. The net effect of all these delays was that we wasted almost four hours of our short vacation waiting either in the lobby or in our room without our bags. <br><br>Here's the scary thing: \\xa0I am a gold member who was paying cash. If this was my experience, I shudder to think what the average experience would be.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The hotel is very nice. The lounge is beautiful. The rooms are nice but the bathroom could be bigger (two vanities). Also the room does not have a fridge or microwave. <br><br>The front desk staff are very nice. Overall good stay, we will be back.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I read many of the reviews of this location and I cannot comprehend the complacency of this property. \\xa0I am from So Cal and when I'm in NYC location is everything to me. Sure you are literally in Times Square and night seems like it day but that's what you sign up for when you stay in Times Square. \\xa0<br><br>Also the sizes of the rooms compared to other hotels in the area are great. \\xa0Space is limited in NYC and the W does a great job maximizing that for your stay. It's a great property in an amazing location. \\xa0<br><br>Now to the stars of the property, the staff. \\xa0My trip was plagued with many set backs, no fault of the W. \\xa0From before I stepped foot on the property they were hard at work taking care of me and adjusting to my needs while I was stuck in LAX. <br><br>When I finally arrived late that evening, there was a techincal difficulty and a mix up at the front desk. They jumped on it and upgraded me to a higher floor with a view of the Hudson. \\xa0Then the next night there was another technical difficulty and it was as if lighting struck for a third time on my trip. \\xa0Without missing a beat, the staff at the W went the extra mile to make sure we were taken care of. \\xa0They graciously extended me an additional upgrade to make sure I was more than taken care of. <br><br>Not once they I find the staff to be rude, short or court with the guest. What I did see was many guest being rude to the staff and with a smile they always took care of the situation. \\xa0<br><br>If you want to stay at a location where they make you feel like you are at home, choose the W Times Square. If you want to be treated like a mad cabbie ripping through the city streets, well stay anywhere else and you will see the stark difference. <br><br>A big thank you to Jae. I'm not sure if that is the correct spelling of her name but she was amazing. She looks like Kimora Lee Simmons little sister but minus the diva attitude. She is an absolute doll and this I saw in action not just with me but with all the guest she attended while I patiently waited in line. The world is a greater place because she is in it. <br><br>Thank you to all of the staff at the W for making our stay unforgettable. You will truly be missed...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Let me begin by saying I love the entire W franchise. We booked the cool corner room the view was nice of the city it was aesthetically good looking. When we arrived to the hotel around 10 pm after dinner there was party going on the same floor. Yet it wasn't noisy at all in our rooms. Great room, great experience. Although I would say I was taken aback from the size the beau booked it if I had I would've booked a suite. There was nothing wrong with the room just I believe the bigger the better!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This hotel is the worst, most customer unfriendly hotel I have ever come across in my 64 years! I made a reservation thru orbitz for this weekend (oct 7-9), from Fort Lauderdale to New York. Then hurricane Matthew arrives last night (oct 6).<br>My flight (jet blue), was willing to change the flight to a later date, even though the original flight was scheduled to leave on time today. However, the hotel was not willing to rebook me to a later date! They said unless the flight was cancelled, they would not rebook.<br>The W hotel does not seem to understand that it takes a full day to prepare for hurricanes here, putting up storm shutters at my business and home, bringing in anything that could become a flying object outside, etc. now that the hurricane has passed, it takes a full day (the original travel day), to take the storm shutters down and return everything back to the way it was.<br>I wanted to move our trip to December. Orbitz and Jet blue were willing; the W hotel was not. This is another example of a large corporation who doesn't give a rats ass about their clients.<br>I will never stay at a W Hotel ever again, and will not stay at any of their parent company's hotels either (Starwood).<br>I would encourage all readers here to look for other, more customer friendly hotels in New York.<br><br>Earl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I would never stay there ever again. <br>W hotel made a really bad mistake regarding my reservation; the only reservation I made was 9/15/16-9/16/16 (confirmation # 871673741), but W made another reservation under my name (9/14/16-9/15/16, which I was not aware of) and charged. A manager in accounting department kept telling me that they are going to investigate my case, but not responded yet. It is an unacceptable mistake. I will call up my credit card company first in the morning tomorrow and cancel the transaction. Very unpleasant and disappointing.</br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Probably the best SPG option in Times Square (Chatwal doesn't count b/c if you can afford or expense the Chatwal, you're not reading reviews on Yelp) and likely one of the least run down W's in New York.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">W properties have always set a notch when it comes to cool &amp; swanky looking modern hotels and this one in Times Square doesn't disappoint. Location wise it's totally a dream and even if you didn't get the breakfast package, no worries - there's a huge Starbucks and a tiny Baked by Melissa right across the street. <br>The highlight of this W is definitely the bed - the bed is so awesome that all your tiredness seems to vaporise the moment you sink into it - other than the bed the room was of a decent size (corner room) and well maintained. The only thing that I would complain about is that the windows could have been thicker - night noise from Times Square does seep in, however high you are. <br>The Bliss toiletries are really awesome and they are always well stocked. Overall service is polite but nothing exceptional. <br>The hotel is a tad bit on the pricier side but then it's NY - not surprising.</br></br></br></p>,\n",

If I didn't know better I would have thought it was a Motel 6. Gross! \\xa0The plastic headboard was cracked and falling apart. The room was a Disaster especially for the rates they charge. The only good thing about this place is the location. I will never stay here again.

       " <p lang=\"en\">Location was great, steps away from anything. \\xa0housekeeping staff was great as well. \\xa0only two bright sides. \\xa0 \\xa0<br><br>I understand the building was undergoing a remodel, but I expected much more from a W Hotel. \\xa0I will probably not stay at a W again, It wasn't much better than a motel 6 with more floors.<br><br>at check in, \\xa0the staff didn't bother to help us find our SPG rewards information. \\xa0 the rooms were okay, size was tiny, but can be expected for times square, \\xa0but the bathroom had a see through door???? why in the world would you have a see through door??? that makes no sense, \\xa0that spells low class strip joint. \\xa0and yes they are in a remodel, but why have see through doors in the first place? \\xa0 \\xa0the floors throughout the hotel had stains. \\xa0just didn't fell clean, \\xa0 \\xa0<br><br>the staff outside the main entrance was horrible. tall slender man at the door kept putting us in expensive town cars instead of getting us taxis. \\xa0 he must have gotten a kick back. \\xa0<br><br>overall, it was okay due to the location being in the middle of everything. \\xa0but would not stay there again or any W hotels again as a result.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My Fianc\\xe9 and I stayed Friday and Saturday night and really enjoyed our stay. To be honest I was not looking forward to the location because being from New York you were always taught to steer clear of Times Square because of all the tourists. But since we were seeing a broadway play it was perfect. Upon arrival we informed the front desk that we just got engaged. Jonathan was so kind that he upgraded our room from the 12th floor to the 48th floor and gave us two free drink tickets. The room was nice, modern, and clean. The bathroom was filled with awesome bliss products. My only complaint is that the bed is not that comfortable and the pillows are too soft. Other than that we really loved staying here and would return!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love anything chic, hip, and full of young fun people and what other place to stay other than the W Hotel?! \\xa0I've been to the W in LA numerous of times so I knew as a first timer in NY, I'd be satisfied staying at this hotel on my trip. \\xa0<br><br>Being a tourist for a few days, I wanted to stay in Times Square but I quickly regretted the moment I got there. \\xa0Trying to get from point A to B is CRAZY HECTIC and I was getting irritated from all the rush so if you have little patience for ALL that, I suggest you book a room somewhere quieter. \\xa0Other than OUTSIDE of the hotel, the decor and atmosphere are pretty much similar to all the other W's. \\xa0The concierge and everyone working in front \\xa0are on the younger side and they have music bumpin as soon as you walk in. \\xa0The rooms are spacious and unfortunately, we got a crappy view but our king sized bed was really comfy and they use BLISS products!! \\xa0<br><br>The downside about staying here were a few minor things.<br>1. They do NOT give you new shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. when they clean your room. \\xa0You have to ask for them each time which is kind of annoying. \\xa0<br>2. They do not have complimentary coffee in the lobby so I asked concierge where I can get some coffee and he said I can call room service and they will bring me complimentary coffee to my room. \\xa0Called room service and kindly, they brought me 2 packaged Starbucks grounded coffee, coffee filters, and cups all in a small brown bag. \\xa0What are we missing here? A coffee maker! I could not find a coffee maker anywhere in the room and by then, I didn't want to wait for them to bring me a coffee maker to the room. Bummer. However, they do have Starbucks across the street which I spotted that night.<br>3. If you want to get a buzz goin or wind down a bit but don't want to step out to all the chaos, they do not have a hotel bar/lounge. \\xa0They have a seafood restaurant downstairs called Blue Fin but I think you need to order food as well (not 100% sure). <br>4. No free-wifi<br><br>Overall my stay here was okay. \\xa0I probably will stay at a calmer place next time. <br> <br>Btw, ran into Craig Robinson in the elevator =)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We had an amazing stay here for my birthday. The rooms were clean, updated, and comfortable. I loved the bliss products in the bathroom. The service was prompt and friendly. The manager knew it was my birthday and had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we got back from our show. The hotel itself is conveniently located and security out front is very helpful when you need directions. We loved it here and will be returning.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The three stars are for the hotel itself, its location, the kind workers, and the nice rooms. However, this was a miss for me because it was soooo noisy I didn't get more than 3 hours of sleep each night. They were sooo kind to let us switch rooms to a less noisy spot of the hotel, but honestly, it was just as noisy. This hotel is wonderful if you are looking to party all night long to hip hop music (be prepared to drop a lot for drinks, though, $37 for a small margarita and a Moscow mule not including tip). The service here is wonderful, though! They were so accommodating. It was my fault for not realizing how noisy it would be. Girls gotta sleep! Haha.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Currently staying here on business. At the time of this review the hotel is undergoing major renovations within the lounge area and only the BlueFin bar is open. \\xa0A lot of the elevators are not working due to construction.<br><br>Now to my actual review:<br>Upon checking in, the front desk staff was nice. \\xa0The girl behind the desk helped me track down my long lost SPG points and upgraded me. \\xa0The hotel room is a bit smaller than I remember but nothing bad. \\xa0The towels are soft and the toiletries are nice. \\xa0Couple robes in the closet as well.<br><br>Now to the closet. \\xa0It is TINY! \\xa0I'm staying here for 4 nights. \\xa0Have 3 suits additional shirts for going out and other clothes. \\xa0The closet is so small I had to take out the ironing board and it's still packed wall to wall. \\xa0It cant be anything more than 20\" wide. Maybe less. \\xa0<br><br>The bathroom is nice and modern. However, the shower head is super low. I'm 6' and the shower head was basically at my chin. \\xa0So I had to bend over to wash my hair - never had to do that before. \\xa0<br><br>The TV seems dated and there is a nice chase lounge chair by the window. \\xa0Currently where all of my other clothes are spread out on. \\xa0The room could use a bit more lighting though. <br><br>Of course everything in the mini bar and snack bar are ridiculously over priced but there are lots of options. \\xa0The mini bar is stacked and has everything. <br><br>The location is great but depending on what floor you are will determine your noise level. \\xa0My room is on the 31st floor and it was not loud at all. \\xa0<br><br>Business travelers be aware - TONS of tourists, screaming kids and strollers everywhere. \\xa0The location is clutch and in the middle of everything. \\xa0 \\xa0I was also never told about WiFi so i'm not too sure if it's free for paid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've stayed here twice over the past 2 years or so. It's in the perfect location to everything. \\xa0The one drawback is that it's in the middle of the clustersmurf that is Times Square. \\xa0There's thousands of people day and night, at all hours. <br><br>This is a standard W. \\xa0Thumping EDM blaring in the lobby, low lights, and a friendly stylish staff. \\xa0 I had a higher floor corner room, so it was a larger than normal room, overlooking Times Square itself. <br><br>Would I go there again? Absolutely.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've stayed at the W twice-once with 3 other women for a bachelorette and another time with my boyfriend for a romantic celebration. <br><br>The first time was about 2 years ago before they started renovating the lobby/bar area. We got a standard room with two beds on a lower floor. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. It's a super convenient location near Times Square. Yes, it is a lot of hustle and bustle but you're near a lot of subway lines and it was pretty easy to cab it from there to uptown or downtown. <br><br>Most recently, I stayed there with my boyfriend last weekend. We reserved the standard room but upon arrival were upgraded to a bigger room on a high floor (SWEET!). Check in process was smooth and the staff were very friendly. They are currently renovating the bar-so there isn't a cool bar area to get a night cap and they substituted with some couches for a lounge effect. <br><br>The W is a very trendy hotel and it gives off a very club like aura about it. Everything is dim light and has a very modern and sleek feel to it. I rarely saw children there which is nice. <br><br>The upgraded room had a comfortable king bed, a chase by the window, a standard sized television, a box of snacks and a mini fridge. My only qualm about the room was that there was no real full length mirror. There was a mirror in the bathroom and above the bed, there was a reflective like wall (but not technically a mirror). The shower door was also filmsy. Like other hotel rooms, the bathroom wall is very thin and here, there is a frosted glass so you can see the shadow of someone as they pee or other stuff. The television was also not that great and took multiple hard presses to power on. I guess I had multiple qualms.<br><br>I did think it was a great price for Manhattan because you're getting a very clean and modern hotel with a convenient location. <br><br>Side note, we also ordered room service-once for late night eats and another for breakfast. The late night eats, we ordered the lobster sandwich and a brownie with ice cream, both were great and came out to $65 with tip. Breakfast was BLEH and equal to that of a substandard diner. We couldn't finish it and they didn't have any sort of boxes or containers for us to take it with us. Breakfast was $100 :( Don't order breakfast. <br><br>As I mentioned before, service was great and the whatever/whenever service is convenient and they always picked up and when I asked for an extra bathrobe, they brought one to our room within 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful and elegantly placed hotel. Good music on the weekends, however, the drinks are waaay to pricey for the service you receive. Bartenders have the shittiest attitude. Terrible customer service skills, as well as professional etiquette. Ordered a drinks that was too sour and it literally took 15 mins for me to grab the bartenders attention. <br><br>As classy as this place is, the staff make it an unbearable place to be, due to the lack of attention customers receive.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The W is located in the heart of the city. \\xa0We were able to walk everywhere and take the \"hop on hop off\" bus everywhere else. \\xa0The staff at this hotel was amazing! \\xa0They were so helpful guiding us to restaurants and fun things to do in New York. \\xa0 The hotel is very trendy and fun. \\xa0Would definitely go back!</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">So it's been awhile since my stay there but I still wanted to give my review. I'm currently killing time in line at the W Austin for KGSR's live broadcast for SXSW and it reminded me. <br><br>I stayed at the Times Square location during NYE. It must be said, my experience with this particular location went above &amp; beyond my expectations. I travel quite a bit so I'm well aware of what good customer service looks like. <br><br>The concierge, Spencer Howard, reached out and answered multiple NYC/NYE questions. He was quick to respond and very polite and informative. He helped make many decisions prior to my arrival. I knew exactly what to expect during the NYE madness &amp; staying in the heart of Times Square. \\xa0Janine Mears, Rooms Controller, was particularly helpful during a glitch in the reservation process. She was helpful, courteous, and such a pleasure to work with on the phone and through email. Ed Baton, General Manager also reached out prior to arrival. What may have started as a general email to guests turned into a conversation. Everyone I spoke with was helpful. I'm not VIP, but I felt like it. <br><br>The location was perfect. In the middle of everything and close to trains for traveling outside midtown. \\xa0Very close to the park and was able to quickly get there for a morning run.<br><br>The room itself was very modern &amp; had a great view. A little on the small side but the dimensions &amp; pictures were all on the website, so no surprises. <br><br>Check in &amp; check out were painless considering the amount of people there. The registration folks were all polite &amp; acted genuinely excited to see all the guests. They must have been exhausted but you'd never know it. <br><br>My whole NYE in NYC was a bucket list vacation I'll never forget. If it wasn't for the graciousness &amp; honest information about expectations, it might have been different. Kudos to the W at Times Square!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I would give 3.5 stars if I could. <br><br>PROS:<br>* great Times Square location, right next to the tkts ticket booth (red steps), so if you want to get discounted broadway tickets, this location could not be any better. <br>* convenient access to Starbucks (directly across the street)<br>* service was generally very good (extra hangars and a foam roller delivered to room quickly after I requested them)<br>* decor was funky and interesting<br>* bath products were great (includes soap and face wash - different than most hotels)<br>* treadmills in hotel gym were heavy duty and good quality<br><br>CONS:<br>* the GYM was severely under the size and quality I expect from this level of hotel. Some of the cardio equipment was out of order or missing, there weren't that many cardio machines to begin with, the weight room was closed when I tried to use it, one of the treadmills wouldn't increase speed on the automated touch screen without a lot of effort. Overall the gym was adequate WHEN <br>I could get a treadmill that was open and worked. <br>* SEE THROUGH BATHROOM WALLS - big con. The bathroom is very small, so I get what the designer was trying to do by having the walls feel less closed in by having them be somewhat see-through. But this is not a good idea. There are things that one does in the bathroom that should be private. While not completely see-through, the walls are clear enough that you can tell if a person is sitting on the toilet or taking a shower. <br>* THIN WALLS - I could hear every word of every conversation and every scream of the multiple children who were in the room next-door to me. <br>* HARD BED with only feather pillows. I despise feather pillows, as they inevitably smash down into thin pancakes with no support. It's nice when hotels offer both types of pillows in a room. <br>* location - while the location is perfect for tourists who plan to spend a lot of time in or near Times Square, dealing with said tourists and the overcrowded sidewalks if you are not a tourist can be somewhat frustrating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Note: I am a Starwood Platinum Member.<br><br>Right in the middle of the city that never sleeps sits the W Times Square. I'd been here before and I love the gift shop, which is more of a charming boutique than hotel shop, but I had never stayed here until last month.<br><br>I was quickly checked in and was given a corner room on the 52nd floor. The room was larger than most NYC rooms and was well appointed. The hotel is a quick walk to the subway station, so I was able to get around easily.<br><br>The hotel also has a solid fitness center, with one room with cardio and other machines, and a second room with weights. Water, towels and wipes are all available.<br><br>Everyone at this hotel was super nice, and while it is in the middle of a lot of touristy stuff, I enjoyed my stay here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've been to New York many times and every time I come and visit I've always had to stay with relatives. This time around I decided to change that and stay here. I had my initial reservations but that all changed and man am I glad I stayed here. <br><br>Thoughts: <br><br>Location Location Location. This place can't get anymore convenient! Located in the heart of Times Square it is within walking distance of all the major subway platforms that'll take you anywhere in the city. It's surrounded by tons of places to eat and did I mention that it's in close proximity to all the Broadway theaters? <br><br>The hotel itself is really small. The lobby isn't street level but seven floors up. It also acts as a bar/nightclub that starts at 3 PM to midnight. \\xa0The Wonderful Room (the type of room I stayed in) is probably half the size of a normal Las Vegas hotel room. But it has everything you need to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel staff is really nice and really helpful too. Need directions to a particular tourist spot? No problem! Need extra towels? Sure! Need reservations to a swanky restaurant. We got you! They bent over backwards to make sure that my stay was as enjoyable as possible. <br><br>The only gripe I have about this place is the bathroom. It's so small! The sink in my room took forever to drain and one of the lights wasn't working. Also it's close proximity to Times Square (it's around the corner) makes it tough to come in via taxi. It took us and hour and a half to get here from JFK International. <br><br>All in all I have to say that my stay here was pretty great. If ever I return to New York City, I will make sure to stay here again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Pros - location, rooms and their views (typically), sushi room service<br><br>Cons - downstairs check in can get backed up and the bar is constantly jammed with people and pumping out music. \\xa0I'm all for fun but if I just worked a 12 to 14 hour day and I'm heading back to the hotel at 10PM to put in another 3 hours the last thing I want hear is Kesha and Pitbull's Timbar Skrillex remix at max volume. \\xa0Also, restaurants around are a bit expensive but you are near great thai restaurants in Hell's Kitchen</br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">After reading multiple reviews (some good, some bad), I was not quite sure how I would feel about this hotel. All in all, we were VERY happy! Everyone we came in contact with was very friendly and willing to help us. Yes, we paid $$$, but to be in Times Square, it was so worth it!! We upgraded to a Cool Corner room, and when we checked in, we were asked \"are you OK with heights?\" Yes, we are, and the reason was, because we were on the 56th floor!!! Out of 57 floors!! We had a view of Broadway and 47th St.!! The renovation that others have written about did not bother us in the least. We loved the entrance of waterfalls! There is a Starbucks right across the street, although we went to the food truck just outside for our breakfast and coffees. We went to the Living Room bar our first night and paid $20 for a martini!! And we live in LA!! OK, it's New York!! Loved the lounge by the window overlooking the street. The only negative....there is hardly any storage in your room....there is a smallish closet, and maybe a small drawer or two, but we needed to use our suitcases as storage. Other than that, we very much recommend this hotel!!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The initial entry way makes you feel like you're an in aquarium, kind of. Helpful staff and the rooms are fairly good/nice. The location is alright if you're into the tourist trap stuff or you're there for Broadway. Times Square is Times Square though and full of shitty chains. At least the hotel is pretty good..</p>,\n",

The lobby is very nice and they had a bar that transformed in to a little night club a night. Although i was not going to pay the prices they were asking for drinks it was still nice. <br><br>The rooms here are small, so if you are staying with more than two people it can get a little tight. The bathrooms don't have a \"door\" its a slider. It doesn't leave to much privacy what so ever. \\xa0Just something to think about if your with a girl or friends. It would be OK if your by yourself. <br><br>I was a little disappointed that you had to pay EXTRA for WiFi. I am already paying $500 a night hook it up with some WiFi. They also said they would do something special for my birthday but that never happened. I am not sure I would stay her again. I stayed at The Crown the next night and liked that hotel better. But Hey, its just like.....my opinion man. CHEERS!!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">As a Starwood hotels member, I have frequented many W hotels. Each of them have their own \"flavor\" and vibe but share the same warm and hospitable touch. This hotel is NOT for anyone coming to a busy city/location looking to hear the sounds of wind blowing and chirping birds. It is located in one of the busiest areas of NYC just steps away from the hustle &amp; bustle of Times Square. There was FREE wifi people! Also my room was clean and fresh. The front desk associates were very cool and attentive. I only had to stop to check in and out. Upon checking out, one clerk mentioned that my hair had been styled differently every day I was there. That made me feel comfortable knowing that eyes were open especially in a high traffic area. There was construction going on inside but nothing to lose your mind over since most people are spending their time out and about. I'm happy I chose this location and look forward to visiting again one day soon.</p>,\n",

I'm so happy this gets done. F**k vacuuming! \\xa0Just give me a rug that tells me what time of day it is. \\xa0Because given the low level \"Vegas\" style interior lighting, if I didn't have the elevator rug, I wouldn't know day from night. \\xa0<br><br>Next is the lobby: one part Studio 54 wannabe, 1/4 part WTF is happening here? \\xa0Good luck navigating the labyrinthine bank of elevators, and don't forget to equalize on your way up. \\xa0<br><br>AMAZING Bliss Spa room products. \\xa0Unfortunate see-through bathroom. \\xa0Like maybe I'm not ready to watch my new f**k buddy take a piss! \\xa0The room cards, featuring Tara Stiles, are a \"must see\". \\xa0Check out the video too. \"Long day of high end shopping and need to reset before a big night of partying? \\xa0Try this Ayurvedic twist!\".

Once, there was a mix up with my reservation and, arriving from the airport very late one night, I was transferred to the W Hotel on the upper east side, even though I had booked with a credit card. When I returned the next day the staff did everything in their power to accommodate me, including an upgrade and other thoughtful niceties. Mistakes happen. It's how they're handled that is the measure of a service business. In my estimate, the W Union Square meets every test of a terrific hotel.</p>,\n",

(I used to stay at the one on Lexington way back when) \\xa0<br><br>First off, Olivia J. is amazing! We had such an awful time at a different hotel and when we walked into this hotel, it was just a completely different experience. Olivia was able to set up 2 rooms next to each other and set our expectations on when our rooms would be ready so we wouldn't have to wait around the lounge with 2 kids. (Also, Manish from the previous hotel helped out a lot so we also have him to thank too!) Olivia was so personable and friendly and I really appreciate her trying her best to make everything better for us. I actually had to meet her in person to personally thank her for everything. <br><br>Also, David (Doorman) was so helpful and so nice. My kids loved him and even bought him a chocolate chip cookie! <br><br>The location here worked in our favor which was very close to work, so this will be our home away from home when visiting NYC. Coffee shops are just around the corner and a CVS is just a few steps away. There's a playground in the Union Square park which is really nice to get the kids tired for bedtime. Perfect location. <br><br>I would definitely come back to this W when I'm back in NYC (hopefully that will be soon!!) <br><br>Thanks Olivia and Manish!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

This is our home away from home.<br><br>On that note, one thing that we have noticed that they can improve. We have made reservations in the past with a request to our room like, wanting a shower stall instead of a tub, fridge and away from the elevator. Last trip, none of the requests were met. We paid for a Mega room and we got a ADA compliant room near the elevator, tub and we had to request a fridge in our room twice. The room that was assigned to us was not a mega room I dont think.. we have stayed here every year for the last 6 years.. We usually stay here for about 6 nights per trip. <br><br>Again, this is our home away from home... We will be back!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Also - they gave us a handicap room which wasn't terrible but she told me hotel was sold out and it clearly wasn't (I checked my SPG app). \\xa0I'm used to being treated pretty nice as a gold or platinum as I was last year. <br><br>Regardless - hotel is awesome - staff at front door is super friendly - will be returning again!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Taking a shower at night was gloomily dark &amp; felt a little dangerous. <br>The horrible thing were the sheets. They were so scratchy that they irritated my neck. I woke up the third morning and the whole area was purple red &amp; itchy. \\xa0We had to leave - I couldn't spend another night. My neck is still irritated 4 days later but improved each day since I left. <br>I know everyone isn't this sensitive to irritation &amp; I know everyone doesn't spend $ on really good sheets - but I also know I'm not the only one with those 2 attributes. We spent $900/night on that room after all the taxes &amp; parking &amp; Jacob Javits fees. \\xa0The W needs to invest in some high quality high thread count sheets.

       " <p lang=\"en\">When I was younger this was my go to spot when staying in NYC, but in the last few years the service has been consistently on the decline. The situation reached a head for me the last time I stayed there while my landlord was doing repairs on my apt. I awakened very early in the morning to an extremely loud sound, which turned out to be the shower in the room next door. Not sure what was going on with that room or that day, but it sounded like I was sleeping in my neighbor's bathroom and they were having trouble with their plumbing. When I called to complain the person at the front desk told me there were no rooms I could be moved to, and in a rather rude manner, as if I had called her at her home to complain about my hotel room for some reason. It's a beautiful neighborhood and a nice hotel but the rooms are small and there is a lack of customer service not usually found when staying at a W. For the money there are much nicer experiences to be had at NYC hotels. Two stars for the neighborhood and the bar.</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Decent staff here, no complaints. The room was pretty nice and modern. The location is great. The rates were very high, but that was due to most of the city being sold out. Didn't use any amenities on my short stay.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We had trouble the entire stay, and even when we got home. It was the coldest Valentine's Day in over 100 years. Okay. Our room had a broken window, we were cold with the room set on 80. Call the front desk to have it fixed while we were out for dinner. The front desk was unaware if our room had been fixed or not. So we return to our room to find it even colder. The front was kind enough to get us another room. Just down the hall. Okay, that is good.. Knock knock \"here are your keys\" and \"oh, do you need help?\" One would think that they would have sent help. By this time we are so cold that we decline help. We get to our new room and wait, there is a half-drank bottle of wine and items clearly missing from the mini bar. We call IMMEDIATELY to let them know so we are not charged. The next morning as we head out, we notify the desk again that we entered our room with items clearly missing or drank from the mini bar. Checkout went smoothly. Fantastic! The concierge was to be commended for the reservations they made for us. Okay, maybe it wasn't as bad as we thought. While driving home we checked the bank statement online for discrepancies or whatnot. Lo and behold, an I identified bill for $58.69. Two calls to the hotel and we were told that it was a room charge for food and beverage. A third time we said that it was not ours, the gentleman on the phone says \" I believe you, but I can't do anything about it, call back tomorrow between 9 and 5\".<br>Not impressed with this hotel, the lack of service, and follow through with complaints or concerns. Stay at the four point Sheraton, they couldn't do enough to help us!</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Oh BOY do I love this place! During college I came here to the lounge to study. I've stayed here numerous times and the rooms are great.

       " <p lang=\"en\">This is a review about the \"cocktail lounge\" in the lobby of the W in Union Square. My best friend and I went in last night, March 7, at around 11-1115 to have a nightcap. We went over to where the bar would be, and we were greeted by NOBODY. There was a row of pipe and drape up over where the bar should be, and after standing around for a couple of minutes, a man finally emerged from behind the curtain and told us that the bar is being renovated, and we can have wine and beer right here in the lounge area. He told us to have a seat and he would send a cocktail waitress right over.<br><br>We sat down. And waited. <br><br>The lone cocktail waitress, an unkempt girl with a poor attitude, was standing behind the table that had 2 tubs wrapped in tablecloths, one filled with beer, one filled with wine. As she stood there, texting away on her phone, we continued to wait for service. Did I mention we were directly in her eyesight, and she stared at me and made eye contact with me each time she looked up from her very important iMessages?<br><br>She eventually went over to the computer to put in some made up order, and my friend, not in the mood to deal with this, went over and asked to be waited on. This rude brat of a waitress yelled at my friend and told her to \"hold on a couple of minutes, she's the only one here\". There were, including my friend and me, MAYBE 15 people total in the little lobby area. All you have to do is bring CANS AND BOTTLES OF BEER OVER TO PEOPLE. She begrudgingly came over, announced \"she only has beer and wine\", and recited the list of \\xa0beers she had in a monotonous tone of voice. She then brought my friend her glass of wine, and me, my CAN of beer which she DIDNT EVEN POUR, into the smudged glass.<br><br>This sparkling ray of sunshine of a waitress continued to mope around and pout, and complain to her barback about how hard her job is, and exercised her thumbs via texting for the next hour we were there. Guess what happened when we tried to get our check? MORE GLORIOUS ATTITUDE from this entitled bitch. That is, after we managed to pry her away from her important phone to actually WAIT ON US.<br><br>It happens that I, myself, am a waitress. I have absolutely less than zero patience for rude waitstaff because I AM waitstaff. You are NEVER too busy to forget your damn manners. Because I feel so passionately about this, I went over to the front desk and asked the attendant to whom I should speak about the appalling service. The man at the desk (Matt? Mike?) told me that the restaurant and cocktail lobby are run by a group called the \\xa0Gerber Group, and that they are not affiliated with them in any way. Well, guess what Matt or Mike? They're in your lobby. Making you look bad. And I'm writing this review about YOUR hotel. Matt/Mike pretended to go and look for the restaurant manager and lo and behold, came back to tell me he couldn't find anyone for me to speak to about this. Well, I found a place to talk about it. <br><br>I live in New York. If for some reason this Gerber Group and the W hotel think that rude incompetent service from a dirty looking brat is representative of what New York has to offer, they should check themselves. As a New Yorker I am embarrassed to think that tourists would think that this is what service is like in the city. In fact, as we were being treated like dirt, right next to us was another native New Yorker, a gentleman having a drink alone (by the way, he was HOT), who had also experienced ridiculously rude service from the same waitress. <br><br>In essence, get over yourselves, W hotel and the Gerber Group and your disgusting waitress. Needless to say I won't be coming back, not even for the \"free drink tickets\" that Matt/Mike promised us. By the way....Beer price? 8 DOLLARS. Wine price? 14 DOLLARS. BYE!!!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

It didn't hurt that Welcome Desk Agent Stella and I bonded immediately over my name... you see, someone very close to her is also named Jelena which led to a Balkan breakdown of our culture, our people, our food and so on (thanks for the Kafana rec, woman!). A few hours after checking in, Stella had a plate of mini-cupcakes and an equally sweet note sent up to my room. Getting it just right is definitely a mix of the big AND small things, people.<br><br>Ahh, my room. Plush king bed with buttery-soft linens and naturally dim lighting... usually, I'd take greater interest in the view but after drinking a few too many glasses of sangria at my girlfriend's wedding, I appreciated my cave-like surroundings and the 10+ hours of quality sleep that came with it. I loved this bed so much that after my bout of hibernation, I took another nap (oh hello, vacation!)... this is the sort of room that's ideal for staying in bed all day with a special someone or by yourself. I should also note I never heard a single peep from my neighbors nor an elevator ding. Blissfully serene!<br><br>Water pressure in the shower: Fantastic. However - the blow drier was a low-wattage mini model that didn't do much for my long, thick tresses. I put a call into the concierge and a replacement full-sized blow drier was delivered to my room within 2 minutes! Though the room was on the smallish side even by NYC standards, it was well-appointed with a desk and a largish closet. I'd definitely stay here again, or would at least drop by to say hello to Stella. Forget that - next time I'm in town, Stella and I are hanging out! Besties.<br><br>Fantastic Union Square location = walking distance to all kinds of shopping and hip East Village nightlife. Just make sure to have that last cocktail while you're out, because you're not getting any once you get back to the hotel (ahem, I'm still talking 'bout cocktails). On a Monday night at 11:30, the bar was already closed. BOO - this is Manhattan! But no worries. There's a liquor store next door should you find yourself in the 'just one more' situation... and it's far cheaper than breaking into the mini-bar.<br><br>There you have it - the good life, Dubs-style.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This review is specifically for anyone thinking about hosting a conference, with exhibitors, at this hotel. Don't. Not unless you enjoy your customers being ripped off.<br><br>We were an exhibitor at a small conference and wanted to rent a display to show a video on our 6 foot table. For a floor standing 50\" display, for one and half days, the hotel wanted to charge $3159! I mean I know it's New York, but in what world is that even remotely reasonable?<br><br>After I pushed back, it suddenly dropped $1000 - the price for a 40\" but they were willing to do it for this price. So generous!<br><br>After I pushed back again, they offered me a desktop 32\" display for the bargain price $1360.<br><br>I told them to forget it, that I would just bring a small display of my own and use that. I was then told that due to union regulations, I couldn't do that, and that if I did, i would be charged \"shadow labor\" at $135/hour and there was a minimum time of 8 hours.<br><br>So now we're at $1080 for nothing, literally they weren't being asked to do anything, not even plug it in. <br><br>They then proceeded to police the set up day and inform other exhibitors, who had not had the pleasure of this ridiculous exchange of emails, that they would be charged the same amount if they took the display out of their box. Others, faced with the same predicament forked out the $3K - so at least they got to make some money.<br><br>Look, I'm no expert, and while I am sure union regulations have helped remove a great deal of illegal and unfair treatment of hotel workers, I am pretty sure they weren't put into place to fleece companies, that have already spent thousands of dollars to exhibit at events, to be ripped off by greedy hotel chains wanting money for doing ab-so-lute-ly nothing.<br><br>I hope I never have to return to this hotel, but if I do, it won't be by choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

There was nobody at the door to help me lug in all of my cumbersome bags (by myself), and the room feels stale and dingy. The TV and the controller are from decades past.<br><br>But none of these are the reason I called my office in L.A. upon arrival and begged them to move me to a different hotel for the remaining 5 nights. I could cope with all of the above, I just wouldn't return. The thing that literally sent me running for the streets was THE SMELL. Oh boy....the whole hotel, from the lobby, to the halls, to the guest rooms (where it is the strongest) reeks like the world's cheapest air freshener. It is overpowering and you cannot escape it. It feels seedy, like they need a wash and an update, but instead of doing that, they piped in \"extra fresh #9\" in such abundance that it actually makes me sneeze.

WiFi was OK, cleaning service was inconsistent in terms of when they came by, and when I had an issue with my safe, they ompletely forgot. \\xa0I'll look for another spot next time I am in the area.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Amazing location, great customer service and beautiful views of New York City. <br><br>All of my stays at the W have been exceptional. Probably the most comfortable bedding in NYC. <br><br>The valets are also great!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The girlfriend and I arrived in New York at Penn Station and hopped a cab to our weekend base of operations, the W Hotel. \\xa0The W occupies a 100-year-old high-rise adjacent to Union Square. \\xa0The lobby is smallish but like the rest of the hotel, it's renovated with a tasteful, modern feel. \\xa0Todd English's Olives is just off of the lobby inside of the main entrance, however, it was closed for renovations. \\xa0<br><br>Our room on the 6th floor was on the backside of the hotel away from the street. \\xa0It had zero view and was a very dark room. \\xa0However, this was a big plus as street noise off of Park Avenue was largely non-existent which was a huge positive for sleeping in after a late night out. \\xa0As for the room, it was small, but tastefully furnished. \\xa0 The bed was exceedingly comfortable and the linens were soft and felt high thread count. \\xa0The bathroom, while not large, was well-suited to the job. \\xa0Hot water was available practically on demand requiring little wait for the shower or sink to heat up. \\xa0Plenty of thick towels were on hand and the soap and shampoo possessed a pleasant lemon-sage scent. \\xa0<br><br>The W's two best features, in my opinion, are its key location and a noon checkout time. \\xa0The W is within easy walking distance to East Village and Flatiron District and many great food, drink, and shopping destinations. \\xa0If you want to venture further from the Lower East Side and don't want to walk or cab it everywhere, you're a quick walk to the Union Square subway station. \\xa0Of course, a noon checkout time is good obvious reasons. \\xa0The W Hotel is not the cheapest hotel in town, but I can't think of a better place to meet my convenience, service, and comfort requirements for a weekend stay in the city.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">A decent hotel in New York.<br>Not many open common areas, but it's New York. Big open spaces are rare.<br>Views are pretty awesome.<br>Rooms can be quite small.<br>Service can be pretty bad at times.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love this W hotel. The rooms are much bigger than other Ws in NYC area. It is an older building but the recent renovation makes the room very comfortable.<br><br>Location: Union Square. Short walk to subway stations, easy connection to Grand Central Station for JFK Connections too.<br><br>Lobby: Currently they are renovating the lobby but even though it is in an older building so it doesn't seem as chic as W New York - Time Square, but the high ceiling makes this W feels totally different from other Ws nearby.<br><br>Room: Stayed at cool corner one bedroom suite for two nights. The Suite itself is divided into a separate bedroom and living room. Living room features a full sofa and HDTV. Modern/hip furniture yet very comfortable. Bathroom have separate shower and tub. Excellent shower pressure. Bedroom faces Union Square and totally refurbished. Excellent W Bed that I sleep everyday at home too. Room have very high ceiling too so the open feeling is very unique for NYC hotels. However, the AC/Heater was a bit problematic during my stay. Also due to the older building, sound insulation can be bad so if you are in corner locations like me, you may have hard time to sleep at night if you are a light sleeper.<br><br>Service: Definitely have rooms for improvement. The people at Wheels are the best. Acura car service is a primary reason that I choose W hotel over other brands in NYC area. Loved the people that works there. They seems to enjoy their job too. However the doorman definitely needs some attention as I caught him few times texting on his phone instead of helping other guests with doors and/or luggage. Front desk/Concierge can be a bit cold depending on who you encountered but generally good.<br><br>Overall, although this hotel priced higher than other Ws in the city, it is still my favorite W to stay at.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">How is it possible that I've never written a review for this hotel in the last ten years that I've been staying here. Stayed here the night that we got married and hung out in the bar with our wedding guests which used to be called olives I think. That night was such a relief to be done with the wedding and ordered room service and was one of my first experiences of many at being happy in a w hotel. Have stayed here several times while visiting ny - location is great. All the rooms have been great. Only wish that the coffee was on each floor rather than having to go all the way down to the lobby front desk. Concierge is very accommodating and will hold your luggage. Also the doorman who was hailing cabs for guests was a bit rude when I approached him last night. I didn't realize he was already helping other guests. He didn't have to make me feel like a total douche for asking him to hail a cab. I ended up ubering it anyways since I didn't wanna deal with his attitude. Overall a good place to stay but maybe not as nice as other w hotels like in Montreal or SF.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I am a big W hotel brand fan. Stayed at quite a few around the world. Always good. Always worth the money. As a Starwood member I received a few of their \\xa0perks and that helps. Great location. Not as big as some of the others but that is to be expected. Remember folks it is also in a very old building, so expect smaller rooms and some evidence of age. My only complaint was that while at the lounge late nite and buying drinks, I was asked by the waitress if I would give up my small table for a larger crowd?! \\xa0Really?! Where then should i place my drink? On my head? After telling her no \\xa0she attempted to insist for about a minute. Making me defend why I should keep my table! Unacceptable, that as a a guest i should be treated this way. And although the bar manager on duty was very polite in taking my complaint, not much was done. Unfortunately. This is not the type of behavior that any guest at any hotel should have to put up with. Other than that, it was a great stay. Never let one incident ruin your vacate!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I just added like four hotels to a SPG list and realized I never reviewed this place. \\xa0This is MY FAVORITE HOTEL IN NYC. \\xa0For a hotel you factor in comfort, service and staff, room quality, location, and dining options. \\xa0This hotel has it all, baby. \\xa0<br><br>From the friendly doormen, to the welcoming receptionists, to the large (probably some of the largest you will find in NYC) rooms, to the beautiful and friendly waitresses at Olives Resteraunt, to the damn apples they leave for their guests, this place truly rocks. \\xa0Whether I am stumbling in at 5 AM realizing I don't have a phone charger or trying I am trying to hail a cab in the rain, the staff here have always gone above and beyond to make my stay more comfortable.<br><br>The rooms are large and modern and most of them have a great view overlooking Union Square. \\xa0The surrounding are is perhaps my favorite in the city as there is always something going on between the weekend farmers market by day and the hooligans who hang out there by night. Also some of my favorite restaurants are around here like Craft and Blue Water Grill. It is an easy walk to Lower East Side, Flat Iron, Murray Hill and even Tribeca and Chinatown. \\xa0Also a quick cab crosstown gets you to Meatpacking for some quality clubbing. \\xa0<br><br>Now I just need another NYC project for a reason to stay here again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Our waitresses were amazing and the venue was beautiful! <br><br>I was expecting the drinks and food to be completely over priced as they were in other places in the city but i found the prices to be not that bad. <br> <br>I cant believe how amazing they were to us on such a short notice.

       " <p lang=\"en\">This place gets 4 stars primarily for its location right next to Union Square. I dock it a star primarily for the lack of complimentary wifi, which I find to be a big pet peeve of mine these days. The room was rather spacious compared to the other W's around town. The bar was crowded on the Saturday night that we stayed here, so it definitely is a scene for just hotel guests.</p>,\n",

I rushed to New York for an unexpected trip and they fell over their feet making me comfortable. I could never repay the staff for their kindness, it was genuine and was helpful at a time of distress.<br>So thank you W hotel if I could I would shout to the newspapers and because of my experience I am staying at another W hotel soon, I just hope it is just as amazing.</br></p>,\n",

Definitely need to get the climate under control.</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">The last couple of days I've been on vacation in the city of New York! I heart NYC :) My first stop in New York was my hotel. I traveled down here with some of my best friends and we happened to book our hotel at the W hotel Union Square. <br><br>As we walked in, we were greeted by the bellman and let me add it was a gorgeous day. We were too early to check in but we decided to check in our bags so we can begin our adventure. The W hotel was a cute small sheik hotel. The area of the front desk is very small but perfect. I noticed everywhere, all the hotels were small in this area because we were in the older part of NY. The hotel consisted of one restaurant and a lounge area on the first floor. My room was an average room about 221 sq ft. and modern. This location was a great spot, we were right across the street from shopping stores and the subway station.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Fantastic drinks, nice lobby, good food, great music, fantastic service BUT the temperature in the lobby was so cold it was like sitting in an ice box. \\xa0I was trying to bury myself in the pillows on the couch so I could keep drinking the delicious watermelon margaritas and try to stop the hypothermia from kicking in. \\xa0Turn the AC down W and next you'll get 5 stars!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Not a review of the hotel itself, as I've never stayed here, but for the little lobby area right outside of the restaurant (Olives). I come here to sit and work sometimes, and over the years the area has evolved into a good spot for that.<br><br>The best upgrade is that there's now a communal table in the space with plugs embedded in. perfect. This way the laptop folks have a place to be while those who are here for a drink or snack still have loungy areas. And I like the ability to go from working to lounging by moving 3 feet. <br><br>There is free Wi-Fi via the hotel. I've never used it.<br><br>The menu is very cocktail bar and I often get the fries because they are quite good. Overpriced, but good. Though the real reason i bring friends here to write is the cookie plate.<br><br>You see, many years ago I came here with a friend to sit and chat and, as we were sitting and chatting, I figured I would try some fare from the bar menu. \\xa0The Cookies &amp; Cream looked hilariously overpriced at $15, so we decided to split it.<br><br>I will never, ever underestimate the W again.<br><br>Not only did we get our $15 worth, there was so much stuff that we couldn't finish every last crumb. \\xa0But we tried!<br><br>The Cookies &amp; Cream was three small dollops of wonderfully flavored ice cream, four warm, yummy cookies, a bit of amazing cookie dough, a red velvet cupcake, and a little brownie thing. \\xa0SO GOOD. \\xa0But a lot of sugar, so share it with a friend or two.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I'm giving them 3 stars because for the money and the level of hotel this is it should be much better. <br><br>The hotel itself is great. Nice size rooms, clean and well appointed. Starwood hotels have great beds, and the W has comforters and sheets that are second to none. \\xa0<br><br>We are \"Gold\" members of their rewards program. Of all the Starwood hotels we stayed at this year--7 different properties, this was the highest level with the least service. And we are such easy guests! \\xa0I'm not sure why the loby staff is so allof and unhelpful but they seem uninterested in their guests. <br><br>We had to argue for free wiFi even though we should have been given it with our Starwood membership. And the supposed super fast wiFi was only about a 4.5mbps speed. Slow compared to home and other Sheraton hotels. If we hqd been paying the $15 a day for high-speed access I would have been upset.)<br><br>The water pressure was terrible. This seems to be a problem at all Starwood hotels these days but this was particularly poor. <br><br>The room was a bit lager than many Manhattan hotels. The views were great up on 16 and the elevator was speedy. Again, we were happy for our 3 days but for the money being charged at a W you have a right to expect more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

He was very diligent with our drinks and attentive. \\xa0He made it a personal experience.<br><br>The hotel was gorgeous, of course, it IS the W! \\xa0<br><br>Negatives: \\xa0When I arrived room was a little dirty, empty open red bull can in the mini-fridge, and phone disconnected and not working to call down to the front desk.<br>The manager apologized and I appreciated it, but the next day, still didn't fix it.<br><br>Housekeeping: Well...nonexistent, I was told I had to let them know at the front desk if we wanted our room clean, but at other W hotels, this is the standard. <br><br>Verdict: I am giving the W hotels another shot...but not this location sorry union square.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My job requires me to conduct business meetings several times a week, and the lobby of the W Hotel is my favorite place to bring them. It's a beautiful spot with big windows and is full of comfortable couches and chairs. Perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done while having a quick bite or drink. They even have waitress service out there, too, which is great. This past year or so I've become a bit of a regular there and I must say that my favorite waitress, Morgan, is very attentive and sweet. I had a VIP client meet with me last week and he wasn't happy with the food he ordered. She quickly took care of it and went above and beyond to make sure we left happy and taken care of. Only downside is how far of a trek the restrooms are!<br><br>Finally, be sure to try the \"Troublemaker\" drink - very tasty ;-)</br></br></p>,\n",

The hotel was quite busy and they never seemed to have all the elevators running which was an annoyance. The lobby looks nice, but is quite small and the lobby bar is pretty unexciting. I had a suite which was fine, though as it fairly typical in NYC it was the size of a pillbox. My room was wonderfully quiet and perfectly comfortable... so no serious complaints on the basics, but I don't think I'll use them for my regular work visits.</p>,\n",

Check in was courteous &amp; easy. The property is not quite up to par with other W properties I've stayed at or had cocktails at (like DC, Austin, Barcelona &amp; Chicago) decor not quite as cool because this was clearly a different hotel before a W, bar not as cool &amp; service was not as personable as others.

Sadly, on my ride to the airport, I realized that I had forgotten my favorite pair of earrings. I called Lost &amp; Found from the car and was told they had the earrings and would FedEx them to me. I even gave my credit card information. \\xa0Well, that weekend Sandy hit. \\xa0I was certain my earrings were never to be returned. \\xa0I waited a few weeks until everything was up and running and back to normal in the Big Apple before I called the W. \\xa0<br><br>I called Lost &amp; Found again and incredibly, was told that they STILL had the earrings. With full description of the earrings, I was again assured that they would send them. Weeks again pass, no earrings. I emailed my contact their who apparently had left the property, but she was kind enough to pass on my request to someone else.<br><br>By the time I heard from the W again, I was told apologetically, that the earrings were not in their possession and were not sent out to me. Sorry, but W. T. H.?!? I would have understood the first time around, after Sandy, if the earrings were lost in the shuffle...but the fact that twice, their Lost &amp; Found confirmed they had them and then didn't? I kind of find it hard to believe that they just disappeared into thin air. I won't make any implications as to what happened to them...but one can only wonder.<br><br>The hotel staff rep who followed up with me was pleasant during our exchange. He asked what could be done to make up for the incident. But c'mon girls, you know what it's like to lose your most favorite piece of jewelry that went with everything. \\xa0Though it wasn't an expensive pair (thankfully), the fact that their gone is truly disappointing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Having been to several W Hotel bars in the country, I find this one the biggest letdown. When I have bad experiences at establishments I usually give them a benefit of the doubt, but this W Hotel just had its chances only after my second visit.<br><br>First of all, the drinks are not what you'd expect for such a high price. Just poorly made and cheap-tasting especially considering their price (who pays $15 for a glass of Manhattan that isn't even... good?) To be honest, my friends and I believed their drinks are no different from the ones I can get at other places for $6-7.<br><br>Secondly, they have a terribly slow service and absolutely unprofessional and rude staff. It is very difficult to grab ANY of their attention. Seriously unprofessional attitude compared to their lavish decor. The biggest deal breaker for me was when one of the bartenders grabbed my unfinished drink before even ASKING me. She seemed like she was rushing me and my friends out because of how packed the bar was becoming. Even other guests were shaking their heads at how poorly executed this whole thing was. Most people go there and PAY to sit, get drinks, and chat. Grabbing a customer's unfinished drink to toss it away is just super low. <br><br>Union Square W, if you have any integrity about hospitality, PLEASE step up your game for the namesake... (***Don't waste your time, class, and money. However, if you insist on trying this place out, I would recommend sitting out in the lounge area so you can enjoy your drinks far away from the bar***).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The only down side I see is that you can rarely get good deals here.<br>I stayed here during our ongoing renovation which is taking much longer than I would like! <br>The Union Square area is a real neighborhood not canned and fake so you get a good feel for NYC.<br><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/union-square-new-york#query:Union%20Square%20neighborhood\">yelp.com/biz/union-squar\\u2026</a><br> The service here is not intrusive which at upscale hotels service can be intrusive.<br>The restaurant and bar in the hotel are stylish and frequented by New Yorkers and tourists alike.<br>I have stayed here \\xa0during our renovation and my observations are that it \\xa0has larger rooms than many NYC hotels and it is stylish and chic. The rooms are not as big as the Four Seasons but bigger than most other standard hotel rooms.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Awesome location, impressive building and the rooms are still looking and smelling brand new from the recent renovation. <br><br>We had a Mega room, which was huge and offered a terrific view of Union Square Park. Everything in the room was stylish and sexy. Whoever designs W's, keep it up! <br><br>Down the the basics, it was clean, quiet, \\xa0and comfortable. Even though the room was right in front of the elevator, we didn't hear a peep. Service around the hotel was genuine. I think we found our new NYC hotel. <br><br>And finally, keep me away from a maid cart, I love the Bliss products!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

(I Live in driving distance) \\xa0My first impressions were nice, liked the way the lobby looked. When I was checking in, they could have maybe added a little extra effort to make me feel like I was important when checking in. No wait for the room and this was at 3pm, 1 hour earlier than they said on the email which was great! I also loved the late checkout at 12pm. We had the king single bedroom which was very big for in nyc. The bathroom was basic but had a nice standup shower. I liked the bliss products they provide. Lovely view of union square park, this hotel is in a great location. Many stores/food in the area and easy to get almost anywhere in the city. Would deff recommend to anyone and would stay again!</p>,\n",

Best hotel room I have had in the Village/Union Square area, not sure how I lucked out but compared to the other places I have stayed my room was a palace, and for the first time in that part of town I was unable to touch both walls of the room with my arms extended!! :-)<br>Very trendy, good service, great bar/restaurant, everything I could ask for. Can be pricey if you don't get any kind of a special deal or offer as I had found on their web site.</br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I've stayed here twice last year and the two things that I love most about this W Hotel is the location and the size of the rooms. Luckily for me my first stay was right after the rooms had been renovated so I had a chance to see the rooms nice and fresh. The staff at this hotel is also very friendly. Upon check-in I was upgraded to a spectacular room for being a gold member. Two nights into my stay I went downstairs to see if i was charged for something I knocked over in the mini fridge and I don't know if there was a misunderstanding, but they upgraded me again to an even bigger room, a mega room. Both rooms had several windows where I was able to over look Union Square. The Living Room is nice a little small, but I know that it has or is being renovated as well. This hotel is also a lot quieter than the other two W Hotels uptown. The only thing I did not like about this hotel is that I had a waffle for breakfast at the Olives restaurant \\xa0and It was the worst waffle I've ever had. It just tasted yucky, I mean how do you mess up a waffle?<br><br>I've stayed at every W Hotel in Manhattan and I would definitely recommend this one to anyone especially an SPG member.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Part 1 of a Series: The PMD Chronicles (How I Fell in Love with a Murderer)<br><br>If you stay at the W in Union Square, know this: there are delis and 24 hour shops within a one block radius, so do not fall prey to the siren song of 9$ bottles of water placed beside your bed. There is no need to raid the mini fridge full of expensive tiny bottles of liquor or cans of diet soda. If you pay 5$ for a bag of salty processed snacks, then you are a fool. (Of course, if you are on an expense account, then by all means - drain the fridge of all the booze and chow down on pricy peanuts. I don't care.)<br><br>Be sure to request a better view if all you can see is a wall from your window; the man behind the counter downstairs will be happy to accomodate you. He will also helpfully offer you a W umbrella if it rains (and will be exceptionally grateful if you actually return it) and give you advice on where to go for a drink nearby at 2am. If you, slightly inebriated upon returning from the bar, attempt to steal apples from the basket, he will say, \"Why take two? Take four!\" You will respond, \"I was just kidding\" but then sheepishly take two anyway.<br><br>The room will be large, the bed will be comfortable, and the shower will be perfect for washing your feet in as your beloved watches. A quick survey of the channels and movies available will yield some terribly named pornographic films. Do not call the front desk and badger them about this. It's not their fault.<br><br>Hot-blooded folks will be delighted to know that the thermostat in the room is adjustable, but if you try to set it below 62 degrees, the most peculiar high pitched sound will start wailing from the walls. Perhaps you should confer with your guest (the one who's actually paying for this stay), who is shivering beneath the comforter, looking helplessly at you as you continue lowering the room temperature. This is not a meat locker! This is a hotel room! Fine. You will compromise at 68 degrees. What, 69? You are a pervert.<br><br>If you must, hang out downstairs at Olive's, the Todd English eatery. Do this only if you need to saturate your stay in New York with a bunch of pretentious European tourists eating sub-par looking flatbread pizzas and sipping white wine while tapping away on their laptops. This is New York City: home of some of the best restaurants in the world! Don't subject yourself to Todd English, man. This isn't Boston!<br><br>The elevators smell of cologne and nightclub, which matches the piped in music perfectly. Who needs Lavo? Forget Tao. Beauty &amp; Essex? Pfft. If the W offered bottle service in their lifts, velvet ropes would be needed and you would certainly be scraping Lindsay Lohan off the walls, her inflated lips stuck to the PH button.<br><br>W New York - Union Square: it's where you fall in love.

       " <p lang=\"en\">Overall, a good value for spending the holidays in NYC. \\xa0The Fabulous Room that we were in that had a king and a day bed was enough room for our family of four (7 and 18 year old daughters). \\xa0The location is exceptional. \\xa0There were a few hiccups such as arriving around 11:30 pm with no one to help us with our bags getting into the hotel, but that was remedied at check in when the manager brought our bags to our room. \\xa0I guess they were just understaffed that evening (who knows, maybe someone called in sick). \\xa0Also, our iron did not work and we didn't have a DO NOT DISTURB sign. \\xa0Other than those few things (and of course the nuisance of having to pay for WI-FI), it was a great stay. \\xa0We ordered room service one night and it was extremely prompt. \\xa0The staff are all very friendly and gracious, which is something that you do not get at all W Hotels because they are too busy trying to look and sound \"ultra hip and fabulous.\" \\xa0We will be coming back again. \\xa0I do agree with the other reviews that the lobby is dark and gloomy and it would be a plus for that to be a focus during a renovation to make the hotel more inviting.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I'm not a huge fan of W Hotels but this one really surprised me in a positive way. I stayed with a friend and the room was under her name with no SPG status so unlike my usual reviews I can not take the status treatment into account here. Anyhow I found the room we got to be very nice, spacious and well decorated. The location is great and the staff was super friendly. I has trouble at W's in the past where the staff had a bit of a snotty attitude, this was not the case at this particular property and that was the first thing I noticed.<br><br>One little thing: The Bathtub was ridiculously narrow and I'm not a big guy (ok, at least not huge ;)).<br><br>I love that they have Olive's at the hotel as a restaurant where they also serve breakfast. Oh my I could die for their Carpaccio and I find the prices there really reasonable.<br><br>Definitely recommended, I will be back for more !!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here for three wonderful days last week. \\xa0The check in was smooth. \\xa0There is real grass at the desk, and a basket of apples next to the desk. \\xa0The room was nice and large, clean, well maintained. \\xa0I arrived after 11 pm, went to the bar, and, upon returning to my room they had set out a bottle of water and some chocolate treats. \\xa0The room was nice and quiet. \\xa0The linens and pillows were superb. \\xa0I did not eat at the hotel, given all the great places to go nearby. \\xa0The bar is very hip, I felt about 20 years too old to be there. \\xa0It was amusing to watch guys my age trying to hit on younger women, however. \\xa0It is my understanding Starwood is doing some sort of a complete redo of the bar and dining area in the near future. <br><br>As for the concierge... \\xa0I awoke on Saturday morning after a really tough week. \\xa0I thought, \"I want to do laps in a saltwater pool. \\xa0Are they really sincere about anything, anytime?\" \\xa0I called the concierge, requested they find me a saltwater pool to do laps. \\xa0I was notified awhile later that I could use the infinity saltwater pool at the Chatwal (another SPG property) spa! \\xa0It was great. \\xa0This alone will make me come back.<br><br>Although the elevators are old (the whole building is old, but classy), I never had to wait more than a few moments for the elevator, and it moved very efficiently.<br><br>As for the neighborhood, it is ultracool. \\xa0Imagine a farmer's market right out your door several days a week. Perhaps the best raw food restaurant in the US (Pure) a couple of blocks down. \\xa0Great coffee shops, including 71 Irving, close by. \\xa0The location is superb.<br><br>The workout room is ok, it is well maintained with modern equipment. \\xa0There are a few bikes, treadmills, elliptical climbers. \\xa0No pool on the property, but there are so many other positives here, it really doesn't matter.<br><br>I definitely will return here to stay during future New York trips.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This particular W is very special to my husband and I. \\xa0We had our wedding pictures taken here, spent several nights here when we first started dating, and still return every year for a night or two. \\xa0Great service, atmosphere and location. \\xa0The Living Room is one of my favorite spots for a drink, and the service, as with all W's, is top notch.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Glorified motel 6 with a bunch of wanna be Hollywood trash running around. Rooms were small and felt generic, just didn't feel clean. <br>Was very disappointed because I have stayed at many W hotels and they are all gorgeous and one would expect their Hollywood property to be clean and roomy, but it wasn't. The bed was the worst thing about the room. And they don't even offer free Wi-Fi with a $400 room.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Fav poolside bartender is Frank A. Always very courteous and recommends some flavorful drinks. I often visit the W for the pool. I've stay in the rooms as well and they are also very nice an clean. If I'm going to be in HW, this is the spot to come.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The W is NOT the place to stay if you want to sleep on a Friday or Saturday night. The atmosphere on the halls is like a dorm floor after the big game. The noise from the courtyard bar continues till the wee hours of the morning. We have stayed here in the past; it has gotten considerably worse in noise, cleanliness.. it looks tatty. Will be complaining to Starwood.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My boyfriend and I got a room here as a grand finale of our LA trip. The front desk people are friendly. The bartenders on the roof are good that their jobs, a little rude. Nothing that can't be looked past. The bouncers are amazing, such funny guys. One of them was helpful to me during a fight between me and my boyfriend. (Not in a creepy way, helped me in crappy situations more than once) the building itself is awesome. Plenty of places to lounge. My only complaint is that the rooftop closes at 7. Seems a bit early. It's still light out. The rooms are gorgeous, I almost didn't want to leave. Very modern. Super comfortable. No complimentary breakfast, and at $400 a room, I'd like to be fed. But hey, all around-great.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">That was not a very pleasant W experience. <br>First of all, parking is $42 overnight (valet was the only option). Way too expensive, especially after tipping. <br>And then the bellboy asks if I have any liquor with me because I'm not allowed to bring outside liquor in. Not the best way to be greeted. <br>The lobby looks nice, but it was way too congested with people and luggages. <br>Way too noisy at night. Definitely not the place to stay if you want a good night of rest. <br>I won't be returning.</br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I frequent the W lounge area quite often. I've always had great experiences.. the food/service/ambiance always amazing! Until this evening. Juliane, the waitress, was not very attentive and took an extremely long time to take our order. (The place was not crowded at all). Long story short, I was sitting in front of the bar and there was a gentleman smoking. I asked Julianne to ask him to put out his cigarette because you're not allowed to smoke at the bar. I told her I was allergic to cigarette smoke and I always sit near or at the bar because I know you can't smoke there. She approached the gentleman and said with a condescending tone:<br><br>\"Omg if you don't put that cigarette out that girl is gonna have a panic attack\" \\xa0and then she laughed.<br><br>The gentleman continued to smoke anyway and blew smoke intentionally in my direction. He called me a bitch and said \"I don't take orders from niggers\"<br><br>The bartender then got involved because the man started yelling and cursing me and my friends out.<br><br>I left the table and asked for the manager. In the lobby. The manager I spoke with was Joel Herbert. I was so upset while telling my story I started crying. I explained to him that my bill was paid for and I wasn't asking for anything free and/or any discounts. I just wanted him to ask the man to move. I told him that because me and my party was victimized that we shouldn't have to move. He told me that he cannot control his guests and that if no employees wittnessed the interaction that he couldn't do anything. He told me to be the bigger person and just sit somewhere else. I tried to explain to him that us moving sends the wrong message. It sends the message that you can be verbally abused at the W and you will be the one to be displaced and made to feel uncomfortable.<br><br>I wasn't trying to have the men kicked out. All I wanted was to feel comfortable and have someone let the men know that you can't talk to people that way.<br><br>Clearly the W promotes the use of hateful and racist terms. I will never give them my business again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Didn't stay here but stopped by to check out their bar lounge area and meet some friends. \\xa0It's well decorated with lots of ample seating. \\xa0Prices are a bit on the higher side for drinks.<br><br>I decided to walk around Hollywood Blvd and tried to re-enter from that entrance however they locked that door to prevent loiterers since it's closest to the Metro entrance. \\xa0Only way to enter is to have a key card. \\xa0When I tried to get the attention of the front desk to open the door (we could see them in the clear door), they ignored me and another patron who wanted to get in.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful hotel but very overpriced. Staff is absolutely amazing! Power blew in the room, and I had to call for toothpaste. You would think for $600 a night they would include it.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I'm writing this review solely on the Jazz Night event that they hold every Sunday.<br><br>Jazz Night is held on their rooftop. You have to wait in line to ride the elevator to the top and there's a bouncer there to keep the line in order. We waited for about 15-20 minutes. It wasn't too bad but while we were in line a few people decided to leave. Once you go through the bouncer you take the elevator up to the rooftop. The elevators are wide but you're squished in sardine style.<br><br>The room itself is kind of small so most people started piling out to the pool area. The view of Los Angeles is beautiful up here so make sure to stop and stare. There are two bars in each side of the rooftop. The bartenders are nice and worked quickly, we didn't have to wait too long for our drinks. They are a bit on the pricey side but they are strong.<br><br>The event said that it would start 10:00 but the band didn't even start playing until 11 ish. I guess they want you to mingle for a bit and get to know each other. You really meet different people from all walks of life at this event. I didn't get a pretentious vibe at all, people are friendly and will come up to spark a conversation with you. <br><br>Overall it was just okay, it was a nice experience. I don't know if I would be back necessarily for jazz but I would definitely come back to stay at the hotel. The W is one of my favorites and they are always great.<br><br>The event is free! You can't beat free Jazz on the rooftop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The lounge looked amazing, at the rooftop it was smaller than I expected. The bedroom and the bathroom were pretty small too, but it's decent. I tried two margaritas which was ok, not that special maybe its the one I chose that was decent. The staffs dressed professionally, friendly and most were munch of good-looking people. <br><br>But the hotel had some problem like with the t.v that didn't work and the accommodation I asked for before I made the reservation which was to give me a shower room without a tub because of personal reason, but once I got there, they were saying there isn't any notice about my accommodation anyway long story short they gave me a discount and all is well.<br><br>I don't recommend to those who's completely immobile, but those who can use their arms should be fine. Also, everything is there except hairbrush so I recommend you bring one.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is an updated review. Due to the extent the staff went, even though there were many failures on the hotels part, and the valet here is extremely slow, and some staff are very rude and some of the rooms are gross and some don't work (window's broken or some are facing construction, or sometimes have blinds broken)<br><br>I will rate them four stars just based on my experience with David.<br><br>David is what customer service is about.<br><br>The location and decor of this hotel is amazing. But only some rooms will give you an amazing experience. \\xa0Perhaps this will change when construction is finished next to the hotel?<br><br>However, <br>As of right now, I haven't slept in a decent room here. I will be back and will book this place again just because the manager David really went above and beyond to try to fix my situation, however, <br>I hate being the guy with problems<br>I just kinda want everything to go smoothly.<br><br>If this hotel's service and accuracy increased.<br><br>Wow.<br><br>amazing location.<br><br>Literally located next to everything you need (breakfast, bars, nightlife)<br><br>Interesting rooms. I liked them but they feel kind of bare.<br><br>My only problem is, I compare the price point to other hotels in that price range, and I know that they are overcharging due to location.<br><br>But if they seriously brought their service standards up to David's standards, this would be a fantastic fantastic hotel, and I do reccomend giving it a shot if you can get the front desk to place you on a higher floor, away from construction, I can imagine it would be quite nice.<br><br>Good luck on your hotel search.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The bed was so comfortable, and I have an really high end bed and this was better than mine!!<br>Room service food was very good. The location was awesome! Amazing tea boutique attached to the hotel just outside. <br><br>Ok and now the bad, the shower had CAKED on soap scum. I took a video and u could here my nails scraping it off as opposed to some other areas in the shower. The art on bathroom wall had so much dust on it and a black hair. We were both blondes staying in room. A few of the plugs didn't work very well, not a big deal but worth mentioning. Another few items had a ton of dust just caked on them as well as we started to actually look, hoping it was just the bathroom that was not being dusted. And there was an empty beer bottle in the fridge, which we could have been charged for and we dont drink. <br><br>On the surface its amazing but its the small details of cleanliness that would keep me from returning, especially being it such a highly populated city with germs, which sucks because again everyone who I came in any contact with was so friendly and accommodating! <br><br>I wasn't sure if I wanted to write a review or let the front desk know, so i did at first let her know which all she said was oh wow and oh no....until I showed the video so she didn't think I was trying to get free whatever...then her demeanor changed, but I have a feeling she didn't tell anyone of it, so I decided to write about it <br><br>Really wished it could had been a better stay</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The friendly lady in the lobby said we could upgrade to a suite for $200, but we passed on that as we were only looking for complimentary upgrades. We went for my sister's bachelorette, and overall I thought the hotel had great service with friendly staff. They even sent someone up to help us open a bottle of wine with their wine opener (he did it in about 0.5 seconds, when the rest of us struggled...what can I say, we're girls.) My favorite thing about the room was the huge toiletries selection they provided. In addition to the standard shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion they had:<br><br>- Shave kit with razor and shave gel<br>- Makeup remover pads<br>- Face wash<br>- Sewing kit<br>- Shoe shine kit<br>- Toothbrush, toothpaste, shower cap<br>- Mouthwash<br><br>There are no issues going to the pool party on the roof, as long as you each have a room key to show.

The entire hotel is amazingly gorgeous from floor to ceiling. The lobby/bar (living room) area is a complete feast for the eyes with lots of available and comfortable seating to patrons. <br><br>It is also a fairly regular occurrence to run into a celebrity/personality as well. Our first night we spent in the main Lobby/bar (living room) area, and saw Jessica Parido (Mike Shouhed's ex wife) from \"Shahs of Sunset\" casually hanging out at the bar and taking pics with friends. <br><br>The staff is wonderful, cheerful and helpful. Everyone that we have had communication with has been a total delight. <br><br>The Delphine is the restaurant located in the hotel, and the food is incredible.

       " <p lang=\"en\">W always a cool hotel to go to. Love the lobby area with a live DJ, you can have a drink and continue your after party in your hotel.. But one thing I didn't like about the lobby area at night is that it was to bright a lot of light.<br>I prefer the W in Beverly Hill.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">FRAUD WARNING: Check your bill when you check out. My bill had erroneous charges on it. They removed the charges after I called. But then two days later, more erroneous charges were added. I had to call three times to get the charges removed.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">There were some blood stains on my pillow. So gross! I just realised on my last night of stay here, it was on the back of my pillow but I didnt flip it the past 2 days, cant believe I slept on it. Shyt.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Here for NYE event. Staff were nice and helpful. Place was very nicely decorated. Lines weren't too long at the bar. Definitely a nice spot to come back to for another event.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Hotel itself was nice. But in all honesty over priced. Very disappointed with the valet cost!! They totally take advantage of their guests! You pay for the room and then you need to pay such a high cost to park your car each night? Thank goodness I only stayed for the few hours and left. But the cost for parking for a few hours $32 and for overnight cost it was $42 plus tax. And of course you can't not tip right even though the cost is outrageous Bc it's not the valet guys fault. I agree we should pay a fee but it's not put out anywhere so you see the cost. They hand you the ticket. And it was only after one of my GF complained about the cost until I saw the stamp on the ticket which wasn't even clear very tiny out of the way as to surprise you the next morning. Very shady.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I would not recommend the W Hotel.<br><br>Extremely overpriced for the average / small rooms. <br><br>$500 charge if you want to bring your own alcohol. They make you sign an agreement at check in. They make it very clear this is not a \"party hotel,\" however, everyone knows the W is infamous for being a hip party hotel. <br><br>The valet guys were great, they deserved a great tip.<br><br>Our room faced a big dirt / construction lot. <br><br>I absolutely loved the body bar they have in the bathrooms. I called to request more because of how nice they smell. Probably the only thing I can give credit to. <br><br>The only way I would ever recommend this place is if you are looking for something right on Hollywood and Vine. I know there are limited hotels in the area, however, I have stayed at Loews multiple times and find their rooms much nicer and larger for the price. <br><br>Can I have my money back? Lol.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">**This review is for the Halloween Party held at the W Hollywood Hotel this year 2014**<br><br>Possibly one of the BEST halloween parties I have ever attended. The W hotel did a fantastic job hosting the event....well planned and executed. There was a live band, Brazilian dancers, fantastic food (had the calamari and fries) and most everyone's costumes were pretty cool. Our favorite costumes were these two ladies in matching alien costumes. We all took turns taking photos with them. <br><br>We know a good party when we see one. We had more fun as it got further into the night. It was so hard to leave but I believe we left right before closing. <br><br>We could've valet with the hotel but decided to park down the street and make the walk down Hollywood Blvd in our costumes. It was an experience in itself.<br><br>We will definitely be coming back if they're planning another one next year.<br><br>**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Valet guys were awesome. Check-in was a breeze. Lobby was absolutely gorgeous. Our room was ok. Bed low to the ground. Decor was kinda tacky. Bathroom was awesome. Felt like everywhere we turned we were being sold something. <br><br>Biggest issue: this hotel was not good at providing quiet or rest. Right after check in it sounded like the room next door was being remodeled. Mid morning trying to sleep-in we were woken up by housekeepers in the hallway. Light came streaming under the doorframe and the air conditioner was really loud. <br><br>Wouldn't stay here again.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Check in was great, SPG Platinum recognition was nice and we were given a nice room on the 10th floor. Room could use some updates as the bottom of the door was peeling, the carpet did not go all the way to the wall leaving and ugly gap and linens were not all that new or fresh but everything was functional.<br>The biggest problem came when I walked into the Ice room on the 10th floor, there was a moldy/musty odor to the room. I looked into the exposed drain surface and saw a large amount of mold growing in the drain. I am allergic to this kind of mold and pretty much began getting stopped up with the accompanying headache. I informed the manager on-duty about this and she immediately offered SPG points, but I did not feel this solved the problem and she said she would have the Director of Operations give me a call on Monday since it was Sunday and he was not at the hotel. I said great and waited for the call.<br>Well what I experienced can only be described as one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. The Director of Operations, Gary Goroyan, was about as rude and dismissive as any one I have ever dealt with at an SPG property. He began by explaining how many points the offer they represented meant in real dollars, 4K points equaled $8,000 and that the mold grows every 2-3 days but they only clean it once a week. First off, this is not how you ask about what a guest thinks is fair and secondly do the math right. As a base member you earn 1 point per dollar spent, as a Platinum member you earn 3 points for every dollar spent plus throw in my SPG Amex and I am earning 5 points for every dollar I spend at an SPG property. If the mold grows every 2-3 days according to Mr. Goroyan, why is it only cleaned once a week? <br>In summation, my asking to have my 20,000 points returned due to mold and the allergic reaction I am having represents about $4,000 dollars that I spent at SPG properties to earn enough points to stay in his hotel for 1 night. I think for $4,000 (if I'm doing my math correctly) a night I should expect not to have mold present in the Ice room, just maybe. Regardless, I have contacted SPG customer service to deal with this but the main point of this review is if you are allergic to mold, DON'T STAY IN THIS HOTEL.</br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Great lobby/bar area and a really friendly staff at W Hollywood.<br>Was able to get an early check in with no issues and the room was great. <br><br>Spacious. Clean. Stocked bar that was super tempting.<br>Overall a really nice stay.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">People were great. \\xa0Hotel not so much. \\xa0Not really a hotel. \\xa0More of a nightclub with rooms. \\xa0Booked two rooms for my family and kids. \\xa0The W knew we had kids yet gave us two rooms directly above the parking lot. \\xa0The noise was unbelievably loud for most of the night. \\xa0The worst hotel stay in my life.<br><br>I have to downgrade my review. \\xa0Tried to resolve with their corporate customer service. \\xa0They aren't interested with resolving any issues. \\xa0They prefer to play games<br><br>TERRIBLE ORGANIZATION - I regret giving them even one star</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">If I could give negative stars I would. Read below to understand why. <br><br>The W Hotel lives up to aesthetic value. However, as any respectable establishment should-- have great, friendly customer service, no? <br>We were treated very rudely. Honestly, it you're going to pay close to a grand for A NIGHT IN A HOTEL ROOM you would expect at least some sort of friendly customer service. Unfortunately, no. Take my word of advice and spend your money on somewhere that will be WORTH IT. <br>It's honestly kind of pathetic and sad that the W cannot live up to its name. The manager was rude and the rest of the staff is nice, but quite frankly a little bit lost and unhelpful. W Hotel, I was about to ball out and spend racks and racks here with a large group. You missed out on future and current customers. Completely</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Visiting from San Francisco to to see my son. Suggested this hotel to my parents to stay. What a mistake. This place is definitely NOT worth the $$$. Lounge and lobby look good, but rooms look very cheap and tacky. \\xa0Couch had sticky substance that did not get cleaned after requested, bed was horrible, bedding is not what you would expect in a suite at this price. They stayed in the Marvelous Suite and had a view of construction. When we called the front desk we were told all Marvelous suites face this way. Heads up! Their building a huge condo. Not what you want to see when renting a suite. The staff is rude, they act like they could care a less about customer service. We visit often and will not return to this dump.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We absolutely loved &amp; enjoyed our stay here at the W! Of course it wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for the amazing staff here!! The rooms are beautiful and kept very clean. There is even a window bed for an extra guest! We came here to enjoy my friends 21st birthday &amp; the love we received was completely genuine and appreciated!! Words cannot describe how much more pleasurable it is to have a caring staff that truly want the best stay for you. I would definitely return! Room service was amazing!! Thank you Claudia for showing us so much love and taking care of all our needs!!! She is a very sweet lady!!! Thank you again for the wine on ice filled with gummy bears!! Muchos gracias!!! To officer Aubrey, thank you sooo much for the sweet balloons, card &amp; cake!!! Given the fact that my girlfriend was completely done after a night out on the town, being able to return to our hotel room with the sweetest gifts ready for her was exactly what we needed to come into!! The fact that he took the time to write the perfect note &amp; set everything up as small as it was it made a huge impact!! Seriously I wish you the best Aubrey!! George was a great help to thank you George !!! Carlton, Carlton where do I begin !! \\xa0Thank youuu very much for making sure us ladies had everything we needed you are so sweet as well &amp; I wish you all the best!!! You still owe me that carlton dance though!!!! :D !! All in all I loveee the W &amp; will return!!! Thank you staff &amp; friends for an amazing stay !!</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Almost $500 a night this weekend for a crap hotel with no amenities and an unusable pool. When we first walked in, the sheets on the bed had a weird jizz stain (not sure if it was actually jizz but it was a whitish crusty like substance). The beds were very low to the ground and tackily decorated (pleather-like tufted headboards with hot pink decor pillows). We also had to ask for robes that were supposed to come with the room. All month I was excited to use the pool at the W, but we were told that because it was Oscar's week, it would be closed for a private party (we would only be able to use it until 1 pm), which was quite disappointing. There was also a boisterous party going on on the rooftop with thunderous bass until midnight. I wanted to go to bed a little early, and it was quiet hour at the hotel, yet all we could hear was thumping in our room from the bass (our room was one floor below the rooftop). In the morning, there was no shade for the window so our room was beaming with light at 6 am. Valet was $42 a night. Don't think I will ever recommend this hotel to anyone.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Just returned from 3 night stay at the W. We used our Hotels.Com reward points, which always ensures the worst room in the hotel. We stayed on the 2nd floor, Rm 202, right next to the courtyard and views of all the homeless people sleeping outside our window. <br><br>Instead of one long run-on sentence, I'll keep my comments succinct and to the point:<br><br>1. 2nd Floor hallway carpet hasn't been replaced in years. Stains and discoloring from one end to the other.<br>2. Valet parking $42 plus tax plus tipping. Outrageous! Valets were very nice, and there are other choices for parking, but the W is convenient and a SAFE choice.<br>3. Location. Hollywood Blvd has gotten way worse since I last visited 3 years ago. If you have children, DO NOT stay anywhere on Hollywood Blvd or Sunset. The area is not safe, and we never felt safe. We never saw any police walking the streets or even patrolling the area. The area has been infested with drug induced homeless people, many with severe mental health issues. Mayor Garcetti should be ashamed of his record on dealing with the homelessness issue in Hollywood (just as bad in Long Beach to be fair). The streets are filthy and smell of urine and Ganga. In summary, the location is NOT GOOD!<br>4. Rooftop pool area is great, but not well kept and there is no one dedicated to cleaning the areas chase lounges or sofas. I counted all 5 sofa areas unmade during a Saturday (see photo!). The 4 crane operators on the building project next door have a direct view of you as you hang out and catch rays. Dance vibe music gets old after an hour. Need some new playlists!<br>5. We were scolded by a hotel employee for catching a Uber curbside instead of at the main entrance. If we had taken his advice, we would have waited an extra 10 minutes to clear the traffic congestion at the valet station. Besides, it states on a sandwich board sign that Ubers and limo need to pick up out on the curb. I didn't catch his name but he needs to work on his customer service skills.<br>6. Check in was the best part of the process. Thank you to the nice young lady for delivering us a warm welcome with a glass of sangria!<br>7. $5 waters in the room, $30 small bottle of vodka, and $15 for specialty cocktails at the pool bar. You may get a fair price for the room, but they will get you on the ancillary items. <br>8. Keyless entry does not work well to gain access to lobby and security is not always present. Yes, there is an outside camera on the door but there are way too many loiterers just outside the main entrance. Guests need to feel safe. Both in the hotel and outside on the streets - we felt neither.<br>9. If we come back to the area, we will go back to the Roosevelt.<br>10. Forewarned is forearmed.!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I actually liked the hotel room and the pool. I am pretty anti chain hotels, but this wasn't too bad. The room was very comfortable! The only complaint I have is that they charge for EVERYTHING. It's valet parking only (no overnight gues parking unless you valet!) and that costs $42 per day! WOW. My boyfriend and I drove up separately so that would have been $168 for two nights. No thank you! Also, I had a spa service, they let me know that I had 5 hours of $8 parking at the valet. When I went down to grab my car to move it to another car port somewhere in Hollywood, the parking attendant charged me $13 because I was like 3 minutes over the 5 hour mark. <br><br>Random funny story, right when I walked into my room, a hotel employee was in there taking a phone call. It was pretty awkward. But she was kind and quickly left. <br><br>The bellman rocked, though. I was rushed getting out of my car and they didn't give me my luggage ticket. The main bellman called me and had me describe all of my items. He brought them up within 5 minutes. Kudos to him!<br><br>Other than that, Bliss Spa was pretty good. Massage was good, customer service rocked, and they offer a complimentary mimosa and snack bar. The actual decor was pretty Disney-ish. Too Hollywood themed for an upscale spa. <br><br>I attended the roof top pool party on Friday night. That was rad. Awesome job to that company for putting on that party! Great DJ, great drinks. I would come back just for that party! <br><br>Long story short, just come here for the rooftop party. Obviously it's in an awesome area of Hollywood, but you could easily make this a $2K weekend after all of their insane upcharges. Great experience, but I would rather stay at the Ritz etc for a higher-end feel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Wow! We had such a great experience here! We stayed in the \"marvelous suite\" and loved it! So chic and fun. Chris was who really made our stay memorable. He really went above and beyond for my friends and I to make my birthday special! This was a trip I will never forget and will be back again! Thanks!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This place was disappointing. We paid a lot of money for a view of the side of the other building. We looked forward to the heated pool but it closed at 7 pm. The girl on the phone could have told us it was already closed when we called. No WiFi without paying for it. We didn't know it was $42 for overnight parking with valet parking required. Everything in the room was overpriced for example $6 can of Coke, $5 bottle of water, $5 snacks. There was no coffee pot in room and the cable channels were not working right. They also require a $500 deposit. Room was clean. Paid less for a room in San Clemente with an ocean view, a fireplace, Jacuzzi tub, WiFi, good cable with HBO, free parking, free food and drinks (alcohol excluded).</p>,\n",

Here's my review...<br>-my tv/lamps/lights were not working in the room so I had staff come up to fix the electric problem<br><br>-the time on the alarm clock is less than 1CM tall and is NOT VISIBLE from anywhere in the room except 2 feet from the actual alarm clock<br><br>-(the best part) they hijack your phones own wifi service upon entering the room so that you have to sign up for their $15 Hotel room wifi. \\xa0 I had to go outside of the hotel to use my own wifi<br><br>-I'm a drag performer and did not feel comfortable AT ALL 100% walking through the hotel in drag on route to weho for a night out.<br><br>-there is no bus transportation anywhere near the hotel to weho from the hotel (as I do not have an uber account and did not rent a car).<br><br>-lobby, elevators, hallways, etc filled with pretentious people.<br><br>This was truly the biggest waist of $$$ you could ever spend on. \\xa0THANK GOD it was covered by my Air Miles points. \\xa0 I wanted to see what $965.00 Canadian \\xa0($690.00US) would get you.<br>SO NOT IMPRESSED.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Went for Jazz night, and it did not disappoint. <br>We found parking on the street nearby, as I don't know what the parking situation is, but there was no cover to get in (just be dressed well, such as a button up for the guys, and black is a pretty common color. Dress shoes, jeans are ok). The drinks were $7 for a can of beer - literally, and $10-11 for a whiskey sour, so do with that info what you will. The people were friendly, the performers right in front of you, the music more than loud enough, and the ambiance was dancy/ groovy. <br>Definitely going back.</br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I actually contacted this hotel as a possible venue for an engagement party. After initial contact, the hotel originally wrote back quickly with some follow up questions, one of which was budget (which highlighted to me that their chief concern was how much money was to be made in this transaction, not--instead--that they provide an exciting event for a potential customer). I replied that our budget was around $4,500 but we were open if we needed to be, and I never heard back. Ever. Again.<br><br>So, that's fine if $4,500 isn't enough for your establishment to rent out a space for three hours--but at least have the courtesy and common decency to write back to a person with something like \"I'm afraid we can't meet your needs at that price, but let us know if you we can help with some other suggestions\" or SOMEthing.<br><br>Tacky tacky tacky. And if you're a future bride (as I am) in search of this as a venue, even for an engagement party? I suggest moving along. They seemed to have no interest in actual people, but rather, just the dollar signs they represent. I don't know about you, but when it comes to my wedding, I want people to at least feign care for such an important day in my life.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">There's two ways to receive the red carpet treatment: become a successful actor/actress and attend the Oscars Awards or stay at the W Hotel in Hollywood. \\xa0Although I've hosted the Oscars as Pitbull (LOL), I recently had the same red carpet treatment at the W Hotel. \\xa0When I arrived, the valet staff was extremely pleasant and fast. \\xa0A bright red path from the valet area lead me to the entry under a canopy of white LED lights adding to the glamour. \\xa0Once I entered, I was greeted by a professional smile at the SPG guest check-in podium. \\xa0The process was friendly and easy as always. \\xa0<br><br>The hotel screams Hollywood, super chic and opulent in every way possible. \\xa0The lobby area has ample seating in the form of love seats and couches, where one can relax during the day and socialize in the evening with a drink from the centrally located bar. \\xa0There's also an amazing patio area to utilize for any purpose. \\xa0During the day, the ambience is relatively quiet, but at night this place turns into a party house full of ostentatious types. \\xa0After all it's Hollywood and I wouldn't expect anything less.<br><br>The room decor was what I anticipate at every W Hotel, swank and modern. \\xa0I love the layout of the deluxe room, designed for all purpose use. \\xa0As Janet O. pointed out in her outstanding review, the noise level in our room was exceptionally low, where I could hear the dream maker's ocean wave sounds from the entry. \\xa0I thought it due to high vacancy, but at check-in I was told that the hotel was fully booked.<br><br>The location is perfect for many reasons, especially if visiting Hollywood on vacation. There's a Metro train station literally outside the hotel on Hollywood Blvd. Next time I'm back in LA, I will definitely stay here again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is a perfect place to stay if you intend to be around the Hollywood area. If your intention is to be near the SoCal Korea town as well.<br><br>It's pretty modern. Very affluent looking and screams \" look at me\"! Driving in I fell in love with the canopy of white lights. Expensive cars parked outside was a sign of the contrast around the neighborhood. But it's pretty much the way SoCal is. The contrast exists in almost everywhere. So I don't understand why some reviews would fault the hotel for being built around unfortunate surroundings.<br><br>It's only valet. Check in was fast. Gold and red everywhere in the interior of the elevator. \\xa0At least six to serve the entire hotel.<br><br>We stayed at the SPG floor. What this means is that we actually are fortunate enough to avoid the noise that was part of the reason why this hotel was rated low by some Yelpers. \\xa0No such experience for us. Slept like a baby. <br><br>Lastly the decor everywhere form the lobby to our room was opulent. Although no robe? Now this I don't get. Efficient service and polite staff. This includes the valet dept. <br><br>To access the pool, gym, the rooftop and the SPG floor you need to be a guest with a card. Not just anybody can walk in the hotel and swim, party or hang out. There's also a very active security presence.<br><br>I am a fan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I haven't stayed at this hotel yet but I was here for an event on their rooftop pool and club area. The roof is an awesome place to chill and have drinks at. I'm new to LA so I would always think about the trendy rooftop parties in LA when I was back home. As soon as I came to the rooftop, it was pretty much what I imagined LA rooftop parties would be like. They've also got cabanas up some stairs and tables.

How could we NOT want to go back?!<br><br>Once again, Olivia took care of us and went above and beyond as always. This woman takes pride in her job and it was honestly because of her that we returned. From our arrival to our departure, she made sure we had everything we needed. Rooftop Pool Deck staff were phenomenal. Our server, Jazmine, was fun and friendly, making sure our drinks were never empty.

Thank you again so much Laryssa for making sure we got everything we were promised and on time. We all (along with all our guests) couldn't be happier with your service.

       " <p lang=\"en\">You really can't get a better location than W Hollywood. You are smack right in the middle of Hollywood boulevard! Walking distance to everything and anything you need to go to in Hollywood. I stayed here when I was in town for an early morning business meeting in the area, glad I picked this place. <br><br>Yes, it's expensive (This is a high end hotel in Los Angeles) and yes, parking is expensive but it's a large touristy area. I expect this from traveling to San Francisco and back every other week, their parking is actually cheaper than SF which charges $50+ a night to park at hotels. The hotel had beautiful decor, was key entry to every floor, rooms are spacious, bed was super comfortable and actually very quiet at night considering it is on a busy street. Customer service at the hotel was great.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I am a part of the organization that hosted an event at the W Hotel Hollywood on Halloween weekend. Not only did the event go smoothly, but the staff was very accommodating and friendly and the facilities were top notch! <br><br>The venue was perfect for our Caribbean Carnival themed event, and the hotel gave us plenty of liberty to decorate as we pleased, have Samba dancers make a grand entrance, and much more that made our event spectacular! The AV set up was also perfect and the W Hotel technicians really set high bar. We thank so much for their cooperation and collaboration in the planning process. <br><br>Also I really enjoyed how the W Hotel really handled multiple events at the same time. The security guards were really diligent in their jobs and were able to keep the different parties separate. <br><br>Our event had dinner provided by the hotel, and the food was fantastic. It was definitely on a higher level than some of the other food we've had at other Los Angeles hotel banquets. For our menu, we had a simple spring mix salad for appetizer, a chicken ((or vegetarian option) for entr\\xe9e , and an awesome cheesecake for dessert complete with strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Yum! The service was a little slow but understandable given the number of people who were in attendance. <br><br>Overall I think the W hotel Hollywood is a great venue for any size event!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">only hotel that makes guests sign an agreement to not throw parties in room, smoke or bring outside alcohol. it's like checking into a dorm. also, they require a $500/night incidental hold on your credit card. If you stay there two nights, be sure to clear your credit card with at least $2k for incidental hold, plus nightly room fees. really ridiculous requirement. other than that, it's a trendy property with a nightclub feel in a convenient, albeit rundown, location.</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here as a guest from May 13 - May 15. The valet guys were awesome! They were so friendly, funny and helpful. $42/night for parking is a little extreme, but hey, if you want to stay in Hollywood and at The W, and know that your car will be safe, so you splurge a little!<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful. I knew it was more of a club thing at night, etc... but I had a really good deal and decided to stay anyway. Everything was great... the service that I received, the shower/bathroom area was amazing. The bed is low to the ground, but that's how it is for every room.<br><br>The big drawback that I took from this is that I stayed on a Fri and Sat; it got VERY loud at night (that's why it got 3 stars; for that reason alone). It's not a \"family\" hotel; so if the noise is something you're afraid of, then go for a quieter hotel. Other than that, it was a good hotel.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I went to the club at the W Hollywood hotel on Friday August 21st, 2015 with a few friends for one of the parties they have there. <br><br>First, be ready to wait in line for about 20 minutes when you get there. They apparently artificially create a line to \"look cool\" since the club was far from being full when we arrived and since there was no other line, either at check-in or in the elevator when we entered the club.<br><br>The club itself is basically composed of a first \"dancing room\" and of a reasonably large outdoor pool area with a bar in the back. The nice thing here is that you get a pretty amazing view from the pool area and that you won't get too hot since there's an outdoor area even on a summer night.<br><br>Unfortunately, the club was rather empty that night, and only a few people actually tried to dance, which made for a little boring atmosphere. The drinks there are $15 for a cocktail and $9 for a beer. Also be ready to have a lot more ice in your cocktail than alcohol.<br><br>Overall, my experience with the club at the W Hollywood hotel was neutral and I would recommend that you go to one of the better clubs in Hollywood. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I was super excited to have a girls weekend in Hollywood and decided to book a room with my SPG credit card. We wanted to go out to bars in Hollywood, so I thought this was a good choice. The room was ok and the hotel seemed extremely empty. When we arrived to the room it had used glasses by the mini bar and there was no iPod docking station. <br><br>There were several bottles of water, but we we were not informed that they were free. We decided to use a bottle of wine in the room and called the front desk to ask the price of the bottle. The front desk seemed irritated that we were asking questions and did not seem helpful at all. I later found out there was a restocking fee associated with the bottle of wine and I was not told when I called. I've gone to this hotel several times, but never stayed in a room and I am very disappointed. <br><br>I later called the hotel and spoke to the manager Joel Hebert and he wasn't helpful and said that he couldn't take off some of the charges from the room. I never received the hotel folio even though I am an SPG member and they couldn't send me an itemized list of what was used in the mini-bar. <br><br>Again, I was very disappointed as the hotel has a beautiful lobby and seemed like a great choice for a girls weekend. I've stayed at W hotels in other locations, but this hotel was an ok choice. I will not be staying at this hotel again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

They also have a room top pool and bar, great lounge and night life. Great service, overall a really good modern hotel in the center of Hollywood. They have a great club on the roof. This hotel is really great place to bring your girlfriends or friends and enjoy the Hollywood scene. My one complaint is that the rooftop pool area is kind of small, so you'll need to get up there early to get chairs.</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">This is the place to be hanging out on a Saturday night in LA. It seems to be the center of a lot of things. There is the Walk of Fame and other sights nearby as well as a stop on the light rail right next to the hotel. Lots of restaurants and shops to explore all around. The bar scene in the hotel lobby was quite the place to grab a drink.<br><br>A number of people recommended we stay here. The line for the parking valet was crazy. It in all fairness it was around 6pm when we arrived. It looked like their was an Indian wedding or reception event at the hotel going on that night. There were several people in fancy Indian attire stepping out of their cars in the valet line. <br><br>Once we got our luggage and headed inside, there was quite a line at the front desk. Thankfully my friend had Starwood Gold status. We got our keys fairly quickly and headed upstairs. The room was a nice size and loved all the Bliss products. <br><br>After dinner out in West Hollywood, we got back to the hotel and had drinks at the bar outside the lobby. It was packed so we headed inside to sit in the lobby which was also pretty packed full of tourists and locals. <br><br>The next morning I went to the second floor coffee bar area and got some complimentary coffee. Then we ordered room service and it was fairly prompt. The food was enjoyable. There was a bit of a wait to get the car from the valet around 11am that morning. Overall good experience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Went to the Jazz night upstairs. The night was good but every time I went to the bar outside on the roof top, I had the worst service possible. Mind you this particular night was not busy but the female bartender had the worst attitude and did not give a sh*** about anyone she was serving because she had her 16% gratuity. Terrible, terrible, and terrible attitude.<br><br>Because of people like her this beautiful venue has such a terrible reviews. It's a shame because the music was good. All they need to do is work on is customer service skills. Not everyone is a snobby Saudi who doesn't pay tips.

She gave us recommendations for food and where to go out at night (by the way we had a blast at Jazz Night so thank you Joy!) She really made the experience a great one. <br><br>My two reasons for not giving a 5 star review are;<br>Room size - our room was the same size as another we stayed in the night before but this one was 3x the price.<br>Parking - yes I know it's LA and more specifically Hollywood, but over $40 to park is just crazy. You don't need to make money from this and it can ruin a trip on an already very expensive hotel.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">This is a beautiful hotel, and I wanted to give it more stars, but you'll see why I can't. The good things are the modern, hip decor and friendly staff. The rooftop bar is cool and had great food for part of the evening's events. The bad thing is that even though check in is at 3:00 and I got there at 3:30, my room was not ready. They gave my husband and I two drink tickets, invited us to go to the bar, and said it would be 10 minutes while they did a final check on the room. That seemed like a nice gesture. I had an event, and I needed to be ready by 5:30. I went to the bar and had a drink and chatted with some people. I checked on my room probably 45 minutes later, and they said they'd call a supervisor. Meanwhile, someone in the bar (who I won't give details about because I don't want to get him in trouble) told me this happens all the time. He said this hotel is managed poorly, despite the great staff. <br><br>I finally got to my room around 4:30, and hour after I arrived, and an hour and a half after check in time. I was starving, and I had to rush to change and do my makeup and hair for the event. If they had been honest and said an hour, I would have ordered food in the bar. I went to my event without eating a thing. I was checking out the room, and the cool frosted glass on the outside of the shower, and I felt something wet. \\xa0There was a red stain in the carpet. I told my husband, \"I know why they were late letting us into our room..\" I found it pretty gross that they put us in a room with a wet stain in the carpet. They must have tried to clean it, but it made my stomach turn. It also didn't look like it had been vacuumed. It's a shame because I found the room to be very cool and modern. Why didn't they offer us another room? The hotel was not completely booked. I did not have any time to contact the manager, as I had to get to my event.<br><br>So that's that long and short of it. If you stay here, don't expect to be let into your room at check in time, and it might not entirely be clean. They should have upgraded us for an hour wait.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">If this hotel is good enough for a Presidential candidate, it's good enough for me. Don't get me wrong, it was a little annoying with all the Secret Service here but it did make the stay more memorable. The W is located in a residential area in Beverly Hills. It's very trendy hotel with a waterfall staircase and neon lights leading into the hotel. Lobby is also very modern and has a steakhouse (STK). Rooms are spacious and mini bar is full with drinks/snacks. They also have complimentary Dasani water. <br><br>Christine Han reached out to me prior to my stay. She had a very informative email sent to me and also accommodated my request for a higher floor. When I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised that she put me on the Pent House floor. The service here is excellent from her initial email till the time I checked out of this hotel. Room was always clean and house keeping did a great job. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for vacation or business. Solid hotel in LA.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When the W first opened it was fantastic, and the remodel some years ago modernized the place. \\xa0Unfortunately it seems like those were the \"glory days\", as the hotel now appears dated, dark, and in need of a face lift. \\xa0Please note this is only a review of the property and the downstairs bar/lounge/restaurant areas; I did not stay at the hotel and thus can't comment on the rooms. \\xa0<br><br>Purple up-lighting and purple overhead lighting pretty much set the tone. \\xa0Those colors made the areas feel smaller, cold, and made it very difficult to read menus. \\xa0Why not brighten the decor and lighting to give the property a more open and inviting feel? \\xa0Also, the seating areas at the lounge left much to be desired. \\xa0Without the included throw pillows it would have been near impossible to comfortably sit. \\xa0Even with the pillows - which constantly shift around - I could never find the right seating position.<br><br>The service also missed the mark for most of the night. \\xa0It took about 10 minutes after I sat down at the booth for my server to arrive with the menu. \\xa0The bartender knew I opted to sit there, so he could/should have instructed the server to stop by shortly thereafter. \\xa0Once the server arrived she didn't make a point to say hello, ask how I was doing, etc. \\xa0It was literally just, \"Let me get you a menu.\" \\xa0This was not a busy night, so it wasn't as if she was pressed for time. \\xa0Another 10-15 minutes after bringing the menu, the server finally returned to take my order. \\xa0This time it was nothing except, \"What would you like?\" \\xa0I ordered a drink, at which point I was told they might be out of one of the ingredients. \\xa0Fine...so I chose a glass of wine in the event that was the case. \\xa0She walked away right as I was about to order food. \\xa0Nice. \\xa0Now, you'd think the server would at least let me know one way or the other about the drink, make sure I still wanted the wine instead, etc. \\xa0Nope. \\xa0Without saying one word she dropped the glass of wine on my table several minutes later and walked off. \\xa0I should add the lighting was so awful I couldn't tell the color of my wine. \\xa0It was a rose but looked yellow-ish. No big deal, but it underscores my point re: the decor. \\xa0Eventually the server returned and asked if I needed anything else. \\xa0At the end of the night, once we were ready for the check, all of a sudden the pleasantries and small talk came out. \\xa0Suspicious timing, indeed. \\xa0For one glass of wine, one drink, and one popcorn appetizer the bill was about $45 including tax &amp; tip. \\xa0That's pretty overpriced, even for a nice hotel. \\xa0Were the overall experience more pleasant I would have been able to better justify the money spent. \\xa0<br><br>At the end of the day this was simply Gloria Swanson pretending she was still a big star.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Room was just as good (and maybe even a little better) than represented!<br><br>The staff was incredibly accommodating. From the moment we arrived to the time of our late departure I felt better taken care of than just about any hotel I've stayed in. Front desk was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout. We had a ton of stuff that needed to be taken to our room. Alan and the awesome bell staff handled many trips up and down for us, personally offering to help us out at any time during our stay with each trip. The engineering department brought us an HDMI cable and tried to help us troubleshoot our AV issues. The team took care of our trash extremely promptly and maintenance helped us with every request. Housekeeping was very gracious about providing us fresh towels when we asked for a swap out. Often I feel like hotels overcharge every guest for a lot of unnecessary services. In this instance I almost felt I should be paying more to this hotel for all their additional service: everyone was both genuine and welcoming. <br><br>The pool chairs are first come first serve. Not crowded at all during our stay. <br><br>The W is exceptionally well located, just a five minute walk from Target, Ralph's, three different Starbucks and any kind of food you might need to procure at the wealth of great restaurants in Westwood. <br><br>Hard to be too positive about this visit. It's also a popular spot for celebrities and apparently the president? There was a movie filming onsite while we were there and our local friends mentioned the whole street gets shut down when Obama visits.

One of their staff members came over and told me, verbatim, to 'shut up and walk away,' and the night manager nodded in agreement and reiterated the message. <br><br>After I went through the Platinum Concierge to complain, I got an email from their management saying that it was not their fault and the staff member in question was actually a guest, so they were not responsible.<br><br>Let's say that it was a guest who was wearing a crafty imitation of their uniform -- do you really allow your managers to let guests be belligerent to each other while nodding in agreement? <br><br>My favorite part of that response was an invitation to come back and enjoy the hotel again. ...right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Ahhhh, the W Hotel. Our favorite hotel! Wish we could afford to stay here wherever we go. It's costly, but always worth the expense. As soon as we walked in, we were greatest by a lovely woman with a wonderful smile. She was very pleasant and set us up very quickly. We got a beautiful room with an amazing view. As we walked into our room we were surprised with a bottle of Italian sparkling wine on ice and 4 gorgeous chocolate covered strawberries. Me and the family gobbled down the delectable strawberries, popped the cork and relaxed right away.<br><br>Later that night we went to the outdoors restaurant to enjoy Happy Hour. This too, didn't disappoint. Everyone was attentive and helpful, especially Jeffrey the server/bartender/manager. He was delightful and we could have stayed all night to chat, but our boys needed to get to sleep. So, we bid him a farewell and went back to our room for a wonderful night of rest.<br><br>There's so much more I could write, but suffice to say, this place is outstanding.

       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed at this W for a boudoir photo shoot I was hired to do. The place is beautiful! It's located in a very hip area in L.A. and the views are impressive. The decor is very modern with lots of amenities, but my favorite part was their PAW policy, which cleverly stands for \"Pets Are Welcomed\" my 3 month old labrador had a great time lounging on the fancy W pillow provided by them along with the fancy bowl for water and food. That right there inspired me to write a review. There's not a lot of places that accept dogs, but they do! Two paws up to that!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This place is such a disappointment. The pool used to be LAs best kept secret. Sure the food and drinks are incredibly overpriced (and not very good), and it's pretty empty &amp; quiet, but a perfect place to relax if you don't want a scene. I've come multiple times &amp; have never once been told the pool is for hotel guests only. If this is a new rule, no problem. But maybe tell me (and the many other people you asked to leave) before we have overpriced drinks in our hands. Or maybe just tell us when we walk in?</p>,\n",

Located in beautiful Westwood, W West Beverly Hills has a lot to offer thanks to its location as Westwood is a commercial and residential neighborhood.

You can also see a young hip crowd during your stay.<br><br>I spent more than a week here, however I had an average experience. One great point that I still remember wass the helpfulness of front desk clerks. My travel agent told me that W was offering free wi-fi, yet they weren't actually.

       " <p lang=\"en\">Really bummed about this hotel. I've stayed at a few W hotels and this one let me down. Hard.<br><br>First off, DO NOT PARK HERE. $50 per night and guaranteed damage. I dropped off my car one night and woke up to a 14\" crack in the windshield. I spoke with Austin, the manager, and he started an investigation. He emailed me the next day letting me know that he and his staff were not responsible for the damage. Completely insane. No accountability or help regarding the damage. I am an extremely obsessive person and know every inch of my car. <br><br>The following day I chatted with Austin and this was his response:<br><br>\"You know... It was raining last night. A rock probably hit your windshield and you didn't notice it. Then the crack spread as it got colder throughout the night.\"<br><br>I almost lost it at this point. Literally no direct damage to the glass. However there is a dent on the A-pillar, which caused a stress fracture in the glass. Meaning, the car hit some sort of hanging sign or post.<br><br>I chatted with the manager and have received ZERO help from this establishment. If this was a Motel 6 in the middle of the desert I would understand. But this is a $330/night hotel with $50/night parking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Wonderful hotel - clean, modern with large rooms and even larger bathrooms. \\xa0My family and I stayed at the W for a couple of nights while visiting LA and we were very impressed by the hotel and the staff. \\xa0I loved the modern decor of the hotel itself, from the impressive lobby to the rooms this hotel lived up to the W Hotel Brand standards.<br><br>My room was huge and clean with a bathroom that was equally as huge with a great shower system. \\xa0I slept like a baby there each and every night. \\xa0I also like the fact that when parking your car with their valet, they don't charge you every time you take the car out - it's a once a day charge and that's it. \\xa0The staff is courteous and helpful - giving us recommendations on some of the places to visit and restaurants to eat.<br><br>I loved, loved, loved this hotel and I hope to one day stay there again.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Very bad service at restaurant. <br>Must speed up service with more employees. I refuse to come back unless you fix up your staff food and service. I came for my grandpas birthday and it was a horrible way to celebrate.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is probably a great party hotel, but not a great business hotel. <br>Great decor, but it is all form over function, and the service was pretty terrible.<br>Waited 15 minutes to check-in because the blonde 20-something at reception was busy flirting with another male guest and seemed incapable of noticing the existence of any other guests who just needed to check in.<br><br>When I was finally checked in, I was given room 900 which is right in front of the elevator and quite noisy, because remember this is a good party hotel. The room was 89 degrees hot and the AC did not work. <br><br>BTW avoid all their rooms ending in 00, they have an odd layout, where the only comfortable position to watch TV is to leave your room door open and drag your chair out front of the elevator. Seriously, the TV faces the entrance door / elevator not the bed.<br><br>Called them and requested a new room. I got someone different at reception and they were helpful and moved me. The next room had better layout and this one had a thermostat that was stuck on 65F, which was a lot better, as you could just turn it on for an hour till it got cool, then turn it off for an hour till it got hot again.<br><br>The one thing that was really good was room service. 24 hour room service with some good choices. The blueberry cheesecake at 3am was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful rooms - we got upgraded to a suite with 2 separate bedrooms. I finally got to experience what's it's like to live in 5-6 star apartments albeit for 2 days lol. Everything was impeccable, and even the gym had free ear buds for everyone to use, along w cold towels to cool down, and heaps of BLISS facewipes, individually wrapped (yea I took a few extra ok!). <br><br>I wish they had a SAUNA though (only complaint). Breakfast was phenomenal - I got the breakfast burrito, and even tortilla wrap was scrumptious (usually I throw it away bc it's dry and tasteless). They put some awesome green sauce on it which further added to the spice - heaped with cheese, this definitely made my morning. <br><br>Every day I woke up refreshed bc the sunlight would gently pour in and wake me up (we had a poolside view) so lots of sun shone through. The bed was also super comfy and cozy. Great time here!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">My room was 80 degrees all night and was told I should have opened the window? I called last night and this morning.

I've never been treated with such disdain before in my life.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">If this hotel is good enough for a Presidential candidate, it's good enough for me. Don't get me wrong, it was a little annoying with all the Secret Service here but it did make the stay more memorable. The W is located in a residential area in Beverly Hills. It's very trendy hotel with a waterfall staircase and neon lights leading into the hotel. Lobby is also very modern and has a steakhouse (STK). Rooms are spacious and mini bar is full with drinks/snacks. They also have complimentary Dasani water. <br><br>Christine Han reached out to me prior to my stay. She had a very informative email sent to me and also accommodated my request for a higher floor. When I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised that she put me on the Pent House floor. The service here is excellent from her initial email till the time I checked out of this hotel. Room was always clean and house keeping did a great job. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for vacation or business. Solid hotel in LA.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When the W first opened it was fantastic, and the remodel some years ago modernized the place. \\xa0Unfortunately it seems like those were the \"glory days\", as the hotel now appears dated, dark, and in need of a face lift. \\xa0Please note this is only a review of the property and the downstairs bar/lounge/restaurant areas; I did not stay at the hotel and thus can't comment on the rooms. \\xa0<br><br>Purple up-lighting and purple overhead lighting pretty much set the tone. \\xa0Those colors made the areas feel smaller, cold, and made it very difficult to read menus. \\xa0Why not brighten the decor and lighting to give the property a more open and inviting feel? \\xa0Also, the seating areas at the lounge left much to be desired. \\xa0Without the included throw pillows it would have been near impossible to comfortably sit. \\xa0Even with the pillows - which constantly shift around - I could never find the right seating position.<br><br>The service also missed the mark for most of the night. \\xa0It took about 10 minutes after I sat down at the booth for my server to arrive with the menu. \\xa0The bartender knew I opted to sit there, so he could/should have instructed the server to stop by shortly thereafter. \\xa0Once the server arrived she didn't make a point to say hello, ask how I was doing, etc. \\xa0It was literally just, \"Let me get you a menu.\" \\xa0This was not a busy night, so it wasn't as if she was pressed for time. \\xa0Another 10-15 minutes after bringing the menu, the server finally returned to take my order. \\xa0This time it was nothing except, \"What would you like?\" \\xa0I ordered a drink, at which point I was told they might be out of one of the ingredients. \\xa0Fine...so I chose a glass of wine in the event that was the case. \\xa0She walked away right as I was about to order food. \\xa0Nice. \\xa0Now, you'd think the server would at least let me know one way or the other about the drink, make sure I still wanted the wine instead, etc. \\xa0Nope. \\xa0Without saying one word she dropped the glass of wine on my table several minutes later and walked off. \\xa0I should add the lighting was so awful I couldn't tell the color of my wine. \\xa0It was a rose but looked yellow-ish. No big deal, but it underscores my point re: the decor. \\xa0Eventually the server returned and asked if I needed anything else. \\xa0At the end of the night, once we were ready for the check, all of a sudden the pleasantries and small talk came out. \\xa0Suspicious timing, indeed. \\xa0For one glass of wine, one drink, and one popcorn appetizer the bill was about $45 including tax &amp; tip. \\xa0That's pretty overpriced, even for a nice hotel. \\xa0Were the overall experience more pleasant I would have been able to better justify the money spent. \\xa0<br><br>At the end of the day this was simply Gloria Swanson pretending she was still a big star.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Had my daughter stay here. Valet parking only. The interior is nice. It's close to UCLA on Hilgard.<br><br>The hotel room was very zen. Service was top of the line.</br></br></p>,\n",

But the W Los Angeles is my favorite.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">For the price, name, and BH location, we expected better. \\xa0Hotel staff was mildly friendly, room was clean enough and the snack bar was well stocked. \\xa0The hotel itself is due for an update - it is readily apparent they tried to make a very old building look new. \\xa0The heating/air unit in the room was loud and constantly running despite mild outdoor climate. <br><br>The absolute worst part was the valet service. \\xa0My wife had a very early doc appointment at UCLA - I called for the car which was brought up when we walked down. \\xa0Gave the valet a $15 tip (on top of the $50 valet charge), and he didn't even get out of the booth to open doors for us or help with our luggage. \\xa0I couldn't believe it (I valet'd in college so it hit home a little harder than most perhaps). \\xa0I let the hotel know about it and they were very apologetic and told me they would speak with the valet company.<br><br>Hotel = ok<br>Valet = awful</br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Not as nice as you'd think, considering the cost. <br><br>My room was really cold because the heat was malfunctioning. <br><br>No free WiFi. <br><br>Valet parking for one night ends up being $50.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We had an amaaaaaaaaazing stay at this hotel during a trip down to celebrate my sister's birthday. <br><br>For our visit, we booked a \"fabulous suite,\" one of their 2BR rooms. It was fab-u-lous and also a terrific deal. Pro tip: recommend using the W website for the virtual tour feature so you can get a feel for the space. Room was just as good (and maybe even a little better) than represented!<br><br>The staff was incredibly accommodating. From the moment we arrived to the time of our late departure I felt better taken care of than just about any hotel I've stayed in. Front desk was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout. We had a ton of stuff that needed to be taken to our room. Alan and the awesome bell staff handled many trips up and down for us, personally offering to help us out at any time during our stay with each trip. The engineering department brought us an HDMI cable and tried to help us troubleshoot our AV issues. The team took care of our trash extremely promptly and maintenance helped us with every request. Housekeeping was very gracious about providing us fresh towels when we asked for a swap out. Often I feel like hotels overcharge every guest for a lot of unnecessary services. In this instance I almost felt I should be paying more to this hotel for all their additional service: everyone was both genuine and welcoming. <br><br>The pool chairs are first come first serve. Not crowded at all during our stay. <br><br>The W is exceptionally well located, just a five minute walk from Target, Ralph's, three different Starbucks and any kind of food you might need to procure at the wealth of great restaurants in Westwood. <br><br>Hard to be too positive about this visit. It's also a popular spot for celebrities and apparently the president? There was a movie filming onsite while we were there and our local friends mentioned the whole street gets shut down when Obama visits.

       " <p lang=\"en\">When the W first opened it was fantastic, and the remodel some years ago modernized the place. \\xa0Unfortunately it seems like those were the \"glory days\", as the hotel now appears dated, dark, and in need of a face lift. \\xa0Please note this is only a review of the property and the downstairs bar/lounge/restaurant areas; I did not stay at the hotel and thus can't comment on the rooms. \\xa0<br><br>Purple up-lighting and purple overhead lighting pretty much set the tone. \\xa0Those colors made the areas feel smaller, cold, and made it very difficult to read menus. \\xa0Why not brighten the decor and lighting to give the property a more open and inviting feel? \\xa0Also, the seating areas at the lounge left much to be desired. \\xa0Without the included throw pillows it would have been near impossible to comfortably sit. \\xa0Even with the pillows - which constantly shift around - I could never find the right seating position.<br><br>The service also missed the mark for most of the night. \\xa0It took about 10 minutes after I sat down at the booth for my server to arrive with the menu. \\xa0The bartender knew I opted to sit there, so he could/should have instructed the server to stop by shortly thereafter. \\xa0Once the server arrived she didn't make a point to say hello, ask how I was doing, etc. \\xa0It was literally just, \"Let me get you a menu.\" \\xa0This was not a busy night, so it wasn't as if she was pressed for time. \\xa0Another 10-15 minutes after bringing the menu, the server finally returned to take my order. \\xa0This time it was nothing except, \"What would you like?\" \\xa0I ordered a drink, at which point I was told they might be out of one of the ingredients. \\xa0Fine...so I chose a glass of wine in the event that was the case. \\xa0She walked away right as I was about to order food. \\xa0Nice. \\xa0Now, you'd think the server would at least let me know one way or the other about the drink, make sure I still wanted the wine instead, etc. \\xa0Nope. \\xa0Without saying one word she dropped the glass of wine on my table several minutes later and walked off. \\xa0I should add the lighting was so awful I couldn't tell the color of my wine. \\xa0It was a rose but looked yellow-ish. No big deal, but it underscores my point re: the decor. \\xa0Eventually the server returned and asked if I needed anything else. \\xa0At the end of the night, once we were ready for the check, all of a sudden the pleasantries and small talk came out. \\xa0Suspicious timing, indeed. \\xa0For one glass of wine, one drink, and one popcorn appetizer the bill was about $45 including tax &amp; tip. \\xa0That's pretty overpriced, even for a nice hotel. \\xa0Were the overall experience more pleasant I would have been able to better justify the money spent. \\xa0<br><br>At the end of the day this was simply Gloria Swanson pretending she was still a big star.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">We had an amaaaaaaaaazing stay at this hotel during a trip down to celebrate my sister's birthday. <br><br>For our visit, we booked a \"fabulous suite,\" one of their 2BR rooms. It was fab-u-lous and also a terrific deal. Pro tip: recommend using the W website for the virtual tour feature so you can get a feel for the space. Room was just as good (and maybe even a little better) than represented!<br><br>The staff was incredibly accommodating. From the moment we arrived to the time of our late departure I felt better taken care of than just about any hotel I've stayed in. Front desk was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout. We had a ton of stuff that needed to be taken to our room. Alan and the awesome bell staff handled many trips up and down for us, personally offering to help us out at any time during our stay with each trip. The engineering department brought us an HDMI cable and tried to help us troubleshoot our AV issues. The team took care of our trash extremely promptly and maintenance helped us with every request. Housekeeping was very gracious about providing us fresh towels when we asked for a swap out. Often I feel like hotels overcharge every guest for a lot of unnecessary services. In this instance I almost felt I should be paying more to this hotel for all their additional service: everyone was both genuine and welcoming. <br><br>The pool chairs are first come first serve. Not crowded at all during our stay. <br><br>The W is exceptionally well located, just a five minute walk from Target, Ralph's, three different Starbucks and any kind of food you might need to procure at the wealth of great restaurants in Westwood. <br><br>Hard to be too positive about this visit. It's also a popular spot for celebrities and apparently the president? There was a movie filming onsite while we were there and our local friends mentioned the whole street gets shut down when Obama visits. Good enough for the Obama, good enough for me!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I am sure it's fine if you come for fun / party.<br><br>I got upgraded to a penthouse suite, which was nice, but the windows were so dirty I thought it was overcast out -- it looked like they hadn't been washed in years. <br><br>When I went downstairs to try to resolve a situation about which I was concerned, the night manager was terribly rude. One of their staff members came over and told me, verbatim, to 'shut up and walk away,' and the night manager nodded in agreement and reiterated the message. <br><br>After I went through the Platinum Concierge to complain, I got an email from their management saying that it was not their fault and the staff member in question was actually a guest, so they were not responsible.<br><br>Let's say that it was a guest who was wearing a crafty imitation of their uniform -- do you really allow your managers to let guests be belligerent to each other while nodding in agreement? <br><br>My favorite part of that response was an invitation to come back and enjoy the hotel again. ...right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Ahhhh, the W Hotel. Our favorite hotel! Wish we could afford to stay here wherever we go. It's costly, but always worth the expense. As soon as we walked in, we were greatest by a lovely woman with a wonderful smile. She was very pleasant and set us up very quickly. We got a beautiful room with an amazing view. As we walked into our room we were surprised with a bottle of Italian sparkling wine on ice and 4 gorgeous chocolate covered strawberries. Me and the family gobbled down the delectable strawberries, popped the cork and relaxed right away.<br><br>Later that night we went to the outdoors restaurant to enjoy Happy Hour. This too, didn't disappoint. Everyone was attentive and helpful, especially Jeffrey the server/bartender/manager. He was delightful and we could have stayed all night to chat, but our boys needed to get to sleep. So, we bid him a farewell and went back to our room for a wonderful night of rest.<br><br>There's so much more I could write, but suffice to say, this place is outstanding. You'll be making a great choice by staying here.<br><br>Cheers!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The decor is very modern with lots of amenities, but my favorite part was their PAW policy, which cleverly stands for \"Pets Are Welcomed\" my 3 month old labrador had a great time lounging on the fancy W pillow provided by them along with the fancy bowl for water and food. That right there inspired me to write a review. There's not a lot of places that accept dogs, but they do! Two paws up to that!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This place is such a disappointment. The pool used to be LAs best kept secret. Sure the food and drinks are incredibly overpriced (and not very good), and it's pretty empty &amp; quiet, but a perfect place to relax if you don't want a scene. I've come multiple times &amp; have never once been told the pool is for hotel guests only. If this is a new rule, no problem. But maybe tell me (and the many other people you asked to leave) before we have overpriced drinks in our hands. Or maybe just tell us when we walk in?</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Really bummed about this hotel. I've stayed at a few W hotels and this one let me down. Hard.<br><br>First off, DO NOT PARK HERE. $50 per night and guaranteed damage. I dropped off my car one night and woke up to a 14\" crack in the windshield. I spoke with Austin, the manager, and he started an investigation. He emailed me the next day letting me know that he and his staff were not responsible for the damage. Completely insane. No accountability or help regarding the damage. I am an extremely obsessive person and know every inch of my car. <br><br>The following day I chatted with Austin and this was his response:<br><br>\"You know... It was raining last night. A rock probably hit your windshield and you didn't notice it. Then the crack spread as it got colder throughout the night.\"<br><br>I almost lost it at this point. Literally no direct damage to the glass. However there is a dent on the A-pillar, which caused a stress fracture in the glass. Meaning, the car hit some sort of hanging sign or post.<br><br>I chatted with the manager and have received ZERO help from this establishment. If this was a Motel 6 in the middle of the desert I would understand. But this is a $330/night hotel with $50/night parking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Wonderful hotel - clean, modern with large rooms and even larger bathrooms. \\xa0My family and I stayed at the W for a couple of nights while visiting LA and we were very impressed by the hotel and the staff. \\xa0I loved the modern decor of the hotel itself, from the impressive lobby to the rooms this hotel lived up to the W Hotel Brand standards.<br><br>My room was huge and clean with a bathroom that was equally as huge with a great shower system. \\xa0I slept like a baby there each and every night. \\xa0I also like the fact that when parking your car with their valet, they don't charge you every time you take the car out - it's a once a day charge and that's it. \\xa0The staff is courteous and helpful - giving us recommendations on some of the places to visit and restaurants to eat.<br><br>I loved, loved, loved this hotel and I hope to one day stay there again.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">This is probably a great party hotel, but not a great business hotel. <br>Great decor, but it is all form over function, and the service was pretty terrible.<br>Waited 15 minutes to check-in because the blonde 20-something at reception was busy flirting with another male guest and seemed incapable of noticing the existence of any other guests who just needed to check in.<br><br>When I was finally checked in, I was given room 900 which is right in front of the elevator and quite noisy, because remember this is a good party hotel. The room was 89 degrees hot and the AC did not work. <br><br>BTW avoid all their rooms ending in 00, they have an odd layout, where the only comfortable position to watch TV is to leave your room door open and drag your chair out front of the elevator. Seriously, the TV faces the entrance door / elevator not the bed.<br><br>Called them and requested a new room. I got someone different at reception and they were helpful and moved me. The next room had better layout and this one had a thermostat that was stuck on 65F, which was a lot better, as you could just turn it on for an hour till it got cool, then turn it off for an hour till it got hot again.<br><br>The one thing that was really good was room service. 24 hour room service with some good choices.

Breakfast was phenomenal - I got the breakfast burrito, and even tortilla wrap was scrumptious (usually I throw it away bc it's dry and tasteless). They put some awesome green sauce on it which further added to the spice - heaped with cheese, this definitely made my morning. <br><br>Every day I woke up refreshed bc the sunlight would gently pour in and wake me up (we had a poolside view) so lots of sun shone through.

       " <p lang=\"en\">Really bummed about this hotel. I've stayed at a few W hotels and this one let me down. Hard.<br><br>First off, DO NOT PARK HERE. $50 per night and guaranteed damage. I dropped off my car one night and woke up to a 14\" crack in the windshield. I spoke with Austin, the manager, and he started an investigation. He emailed me the next day letting me know that he and his staff were not responsible for the damage. Completely insane. No accountability or help regarding the damage. I am an extremely obsessive person and know every inch of my car. <br><br>The following day I chatted with Austin and this was his response:<br><br>\"You know... It was raining last night. A rock probably hit your windshield and you didn't notice it. Then the crack spread as it got colder throughout the night.\"<br><br>I almost lost it at this point. Literally no direct damage to the glass. However there is a dent on the A-pillar, which caused a stress fracture in the glass. Meaning, the car hit some sort of hanging sign or post.<br><br>I chatted with the manager and have received ZERO help from this establishment. If this was a Motel 6 in the middle of the desert I would understand. But this is a $330/night hotel with $50/night parking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Wonderful hotel - clean, modern with large rooms and even larger bathrooms. \\xa0My family and I stayed at the W for a couple of nights while visiting LA and we were very impressed by the hotel and the staff. \\xa0I loved the modern decor of the hotel itself, from the impressive lobby to the rooms this hotel lived up to the W Hotel Brand standards.<br><br>My room was huge and clean with a bathroom that was equally as huge with a great shower system. \\xa0I slept like a baby there each and every night. \\xa0I also like the fact that when parking your car with their valet, they don't charge you every time you take the car out - it's a once a day charge and that's it. \\xa0The staff is courteous and helpful - giving us recommendations on some of the places to visit and restaurants to eat.<br><br>I loved, loved, loved this hotel and I hope to one day stay there again.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Very bad service at restaurant. <br>Must speed up service with more employees. I refuse to come back unless you fix up your staff food and service. I came for my grandpas birthday and it was a horrible way to celebrate.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is probably a great party hotel, but not a great business hotel. <br>Great decor, but it is all form over function, and the service was pretty terrible.<br>Waited 15 minutes to check-in because the blonde 20-something at reception was busy flirting with another male guest and seemed incapable of noticing the existence of any other guests who just needed to check in.<br><br>When I was finally checked in, I was given room 900 which is right in front of the elevator and quite noisy, because remember this is a good party hotel. The room was 89 degrees hot and the AC did not work. <br><br>BTW avoid all their rooms ending in 00, they have an odd layout, where the only comfortable position to watch TV is to leave your room door open and drag your chair out front of the elevator. Seriously, the TV faces the entrance door / elevator not the bed.<br><br>Called them and requested a new room. I got someone different at reception and they were helpful and moved me. The next room had better layout and this one had a thermostat that was stuck on 65F, which was a lot better, as you could just turn it on for an hour till it got cool, then turn it off for an hour till it got hot again.<br><br>The one thing that was really good was room service. 24 hour room service with some good choices. The blueberry cheesecake at 3am was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful rooms - we got upgraded to a suite with 2 separate bedrooms. I finally got to experience what's it's like to live in 5-6 star apartments albeit for 2 days lol. Everything was impeccable, and even the gym had free ear buds for everyone to use, along w cold towels to cool down, and heaps of BLISS facewipes, individually wrapped (yea I took a few extra ok!). <br><br>I wish they had a SAUNA though (only complaint). Breakfast was phenomenal - I got the breakfast burrito, and even tortilla wrap was scrumptious (usually I throw it away bc it's dry and tasteless). They put some awesome green sauce on it which further added to the spice - heaped with cheese, this definitely made my morning. <br><br>Every day I woke up refreshed bc the sunlight would gently pour in and wake me up (we had a poolside view) so lots of sun shone through. The bed was also super comfy and cozy. Great time here!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The lobby bar next to STK restaurant the bartenders Tommy and Kismet are AMAZING!!! , They are the best at what they do and funny too :) . Thanks !</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This place needs a full renovation. The finishes and furniture are worn out. The staff seemed distracted, even for a W Hotel. Basic things like towels by the pool, a restaurant open during the daytime besides pool or room service..not available.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My room was 80 degrees all night and was told I should have opened the window? I called last night and this morning. It was the most miserable overnight stay I've ever experienced and was treated as though it was my fault that my thermostat was broke. I've never been treated with such disdain before in my life.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love this trendy hotel. \\xa0I've stayed here twice when my mom was in town another time when \\xa0my friend from the UK visited SF. \\xa0The Mega Corner Room, Wonderful and Fabulous Rooms \\xa0was very comfortable to stay in with the colorful nooks with shuttered windows. Love lovely blue and soft green shades overlooking Yerba Buena Gardens. The colors of the room are so cheerful. \\xa0 <br><br>I really like the excellent location, whether you are in San Francisco for business or pleasure. It's a short stroll to Union Square and a \\xa0taxi ride to Fisherman's Wharf The hotel is also very close to the Moscone Center and as such a good choice if you're attending a conference there. The rooms are really nice with modern d\\xe9cor and stylish flair. It could be a little noisy because of \\xa0street noise but it's part of being in the bustling city that is San Francisco. \\xa0I didn't get to check out the gym called FIT which I heard is very state-of-the-art.<br><br>Located in the heart of the SoMA district, W San Francisco Hotel is a gathering place for art exhibitions, film screenings, fashion and music events. With panoramic views of the Bay Bridge and city skyline, this dynamic, trendy hotel is the place to relax, mingle, share, taste, and explore in San Francisco.<br><br>I always enjoy going to their hotel bars Living Room Bar, is a hot hang out spot, great for socializing and observing people. Very fun! \\xa0It was the former XYZ bar, it's now decorated with black and white with modern amethyst flashes. \\xa0The \\xa0Upstairs Bar &amp; Lounge is a little more reserved where you can hang out but not feel as if you need to get decked out. \\xa0 \\xa0One of my favorite hotels! Great place to stay and hangout!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I was able to get a great deal on my flight and hotel through Hotwire and the W was a surprising addition to the deal. \\xa0I was excited once I arrived in the lobby and the front desk staff were awesome and super friendly. \\xa0<br><br>When I saw the room reminded of boutique hotels in NYC and it had a stylish and trendy feel to it. \\xa0The excellent location, was good and it is located for a short walk to Union Square and a \\xa0taxi ride to Fisherman's Wharf. \\xa0<br><br>I would recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates good customer service and \\xa0aesthetically pleasing surroundings.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When I think of the W, I think of swanky decor, top service, luxury, and a boutique-y look. I've recently been to the W in Thailand, and my husband has frequented several establishments in other cities. This location doesn't compare esp in a city like San Francisco. <br><br>There is no opening entrance. I know we're in SF, but a bunch of other hotels in the same area in the same star category have that, which helps especially when you roll up in your car for valet. We had to wait for 5-10 mins on the road before we're let in to their valet. <br><br>Entrance isn't artsy on the same level as I think of the W. Looked pretty plain with purple walls and fireplaces. The interior of the elevator was cool tho. <br><br>Rooms are small! Not as artsy as other locations. I honestly don't understand the intimacy with a translucent bathroom door. I don't need to see my partner using the facilities ahem ahem. Lol<br><br>Bar is cool. Has a lot of drink choices. Service was poor tho. We had to wait forever for a server even though she kept walking past us to check on others. <br><br>Room service was good. We ordered some toiletries up. And they called back a few minutes later to make sure we were happy.<br><br>Location is dope. It's walkable to a lot of restaurants, lounges, cafes, and stores. <br><br>Overall, I think it's too overpriced. You could find a similar spot around the area for less.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So its all about the lobby and the whole first floor...has a rocking fun vibe that really puts you into the vacation mood. <br><br>The location for me was just kinda shmeh...there are food spots around but kinda away from all the places u wanna go.<br><br>Room was small - but basically your typical SF sized shoe box rectangular hotel room. Decor was cool...the weird glowing Buddha statue that would glow all spooky in the middle of the night was strange though.<br><br>Good for couples or friends or young people...<br><br>Not great for families.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The place is showing its age. Things are worn and slightly broken everywhere, but there is still a thin sheen of luxury. The restaurant is empty on a Thursday night, as was the bar, even though the DJ was mixing up a storm. Rooms are tiny even the expensive ones. Back to the age problem, even the towels are frayed.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We were hosting an event here but one of our invited guest was asked to leave right after she checked in, for no reasons, no explanations. Being angry but nothing else we can do because it was some \"hotel policy\"? We have to contact our guest and be apologized to her afterwards although we were confused with the \"hotel policy\" and could do nothing at the event. Definitely not an ideal place to host event here.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Visited with my Family to Celebrate my Son Birth Day and another family also Joined us from Canada so we got two rooms.<br>I prepaid the stay and parking but they still charge me more then $400 extra for parking. I checked my bill and informed the Inquiry department for over charge but they sounds not worried about it and not even said sorry and told me your Car is oversize that's why they charged 10 dollar extra.....they not even bother to check how much extra they charged . Then I identify again that I am not talking about just 10 dollar extra per night as it was more then 400 dollars which they finally realized and told me they will return extra charge but they not even accepted their mistake and not even said single sorry.<br><br>I emailed their GM for complain who was nice and promptly replied my email and said Sorry without asking and accepted the mistake which was due to some Technical glitch in their system.<br><br>I am their Platinum member and usually this level of high cost Hotels not only say sorry but also compensate the customer with some extra points or some thing similar but they offered nothing except one sorry which was even after complaining to higher levels which shows how much interested they are to get me back. Off course I am not going to go back there again but trying to make sure other peoples do watch their bills.<br><br>Few other issues I also noticed, I informed them about reason of my Visit for my Son Birthday but they not even sent a single wish card to my son on arrival. <br>In his other birthday celebration we went to Orlando and stayed in Crown Plaza Orlando and they not only sent a Card in his room but also sent special snack trays for him as a good wish which he still remember. Big disappointment for him by hotel for not getting any wish or snack tray this time. I understand this was not must but good to have at this level of hotel and charges.<br><br>Another Issue which I noticed is I have to remind every morning to the Restaurant Guys at breakfast that I am Platinum member and they have to give me the Breakfast Perk of platinum member . One day they even forgot even I told them so I have to remind them again. Usually in other hotels they already know based on my Room number but looks like this hotel is all disconnect between their departments and service people.<br><br>Rooms not spacious even I got upgraded in Best Room for double bed due to my platinum status.<br><br>No comfortable chair to sit in room, chair in room looks like is for a student study desk .<br><br>I stayed for almost a week, some day service people replace Soap bars and free water bottle and some day they don't. I not complained to the service at that time coz those are the small things but now they are good to mention to ensure they improve all together.<br><br>Only small seating space in Lobby to sit and rest is covered for restaurant peoples. Always felt we have to order some thing if we are sitting in those benches and server does come to ask for orders. <br><br>At the end, I don't see the worth of my money spent and will not stay their again. There are several other good Hotel in same area to try. Ensure you also watch for your bill too. <br><br><a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g60713-d81669-r449404877-W_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html&amp;s=c97bd57866db1e65c489366f76280635502391d4383c895b9f582ecce8c6e0fb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser\\u2026</a></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Definitely doesn't live up to the W brand. My $600 suite had no power the first 24 hours I was there, they offered me $100 for my trouble. Mind you, no AC and no coffee for 24 hours is worth more than $100.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">What I liked:<br>The large rooms, comfy mattress and pillows, dog amenities, restaurant, bar, room service<br><br>What I disliked:<br>The smoking policy is absurd. They have a no tolerance standard and my friend who I went there with smokes for medical purposes. \\xa0<br><br>I like the modern d\\xe9cor. \\xa0We also brought a dog and he was very well received!! \\xa0They even have room service options for dogs and will walk them for you if you need it (it is an extra charge though). \\xa0I loved the different ports available to charge multiple phones. \\xa0<br><br>The downstairs lounge/bar was hopping! \\xa0The DJ was really rocking the house!! \\xa0I'll be back!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">i guess i expected more. <br>at check-in was immediately told our room had no view whatsoever and the only way we could get one was to spend another $60.00/night, literally almost the first thing the clerk said. <br>so much for being a starwood member...<br><br>no clerk available at desk on checkout, and sure enough, overcharged on bill. called and spoke to manager who provided ample lip-service and zero solution to overcharge.<br>finally had to appeal to the \"w website.\" as of now not resolved a week later. <br><br>so disappointing to get nickle and dimed after leaving, especially on my first stay at a w hotel.<br><br>great location and wonderful bed to crash on, but will look for another hotel next time in sf for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Our start in San Francisco was a bit stressful due to the damage to our luggage and most of the contents and the incredibly unhelpful staff at the airline company. Upon checking into the W and relaying our unfortunate start, we were treated with the absolutely most incredible customer service by Ricardo Nevarez who not only sympathized with our plight but, whom upgraded our already booked \"Wonderful Room\" to a \"Mega Corner Room\" on the 26th floor with no request on our part. The exceptional customer service did not end there as every other employee we encountered during our weekend stay were unbelievably friendly, super helpful with directions, suggestions on where to eat, offered detailed maps on what to see and where to go and, any and everything we asked for and more. This hotel is centrally located and walkable to most of the hot spots or else, a very inexpensive Uber ride away. The room itself was quite spacious, clean, extremely comfortable, and offered spectacular views of the city and the Bay Bridge. Beyond that, the employees are some of the best I've experienced during any vacation and I plan to stay here the next time I am fortunate enough to visit this amazing city. Thanks you to Ricardo and the rest of the staff for a wonderful stay.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I recently stayed here on a business trip and loved it! It's close to many restaurants and shopping areas, and a couple blocks away from the Yerba Buena Park.<br><br>The hotel itself is very cool. There are two onsite bars, fun art pieces hanging from the ceiling and on the walls and hip music playing all day.<br><br>I stayed in a bay-facing room on the 27th floor and woke up to beautiful sunrises. The room had a very hip vibe including a built in bookcase that doubled as a mini bar. And, my favorite part of staying at W Hotels - the bliss amenities!<br><br>Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and helpful. I learned through the doorman that there's a complimentary car service, and the concierge helped me made recommendations on how to make the most of our a few free hours I had. There's also an onsite gym, pool and spa but I didn't have time to utilize any of these. <br><br>This is a place I'd love to stay at again, for work or play.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here a couple years ago for my minimoon. I wasn't too impressed. My husband and I stayed for two nights and I was expecting something a little more...(for lack of a better word) \"more.\" Maybe it's the name? Idk. Our room was small and for the price you pay/night it's a little disappointing. I've stayed at other hotels in the City that are comparable in price and have more room. The decor was dope though. Very modern. Room was clean. I liked that they had a bar in the lobby. <br><br>The hotel itself is pretty far from everything. We walked to Union Square and it was a trek. Definitely ended up cabbing around more than walking. There are other hotels that are much closer to Union Square that are in the same price range and star ratings.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The W is lovely!<br>Love the decor and bar in the lobby level. Definitely gives off the impression of being more like a bar and lounge than a hotel lobby.<br><br>Live music in the lobby keeps everyone going!<br>Dim lights set the mood nicely and drinks are really good!<br><br>Drinks are on the pricier side, 10-15, but I guess that's standard for SF.<br><br>Might have to do a staycation in these rooms next week!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Great service from the waitresses. They even had funny stories to share, very down to earth folks.<br><br>Reasonable prices. Had a nice business casual talk.

       " <p lang=\"en\">Worst experience! Spent $40 per person for a stupid stuffed and ill managed and early ending Halloween party (supposed to end 2 am ends 1:45 am.. are you serious?) <br><br>The guy tells us to move out of the \"public\" streets to cross anything that says W just so nobody is drunk \\xa0around their area.. it's ridiculous!<br><br>Why would I waste so much money to be insulted?<br><br>We told the guy we ordered the Uber and set a Pick until location based on \"exactly where we stood\".. because of all this confusion we lost 45 mins waiting for Uber... does W pay For that additional time?

They had an amazing gym - all of their equipment was brand new. It was also stocked with fruits, water, and fresh towels. <br><br>I took off a star for the lack of having a pool.

Can't wait to stay here again, but next time hopefully for pleasure :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Great location, walking distance to most parts of the city. The hotel is also very clean, and modern, which I like. The staff is extremely friendly, helped out with any of out SF area questions. They have sensors in the room so the cleaning staff doesn't bother you until you leave the room. Was able to find a great deal on the hotel as well. If you like night life the lobby turns into a club on the weekends.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I feel like an almost $500 per night room, after a ridiculous $56 parking fee, should have the whole room door slamming thing figured out. I am livid that I am unable to get any rest because your guest room doors don't close quietly. WTF? <br>We won't be staying at this location ever again, and I will advise all my friends against staying here because the cost isn't worth this. <br>I'm really dissatisfied with this hotel.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So much glam and glitz! <br><br>It's the details that make this place great! An energetic atmosphere no matter what time of day, the lobby/lounge area with a vintage arcade game and large windows (perfect for people-watching), plus great proximity to the touristy Market Street, piers (with those wonderful views of Oakland Bay Bridge), and the beautiful Yerba Buena Gardens across the street. Oh and those elevator rugs that tell you what time of the day it is? Seriously. Holy attention to detail, W Hotel. <br><br>I put their \"whatever whenever\" slogan to the test when I ordered takeout from a local restaurant and didn't have silverware. The \"whenever\" portion of the slogan came into play when I had to wait 20 minutes for the utensils and was left with cold masala, but later that night when I realized I didn't pack toothpaste, the room service was much snappier. I checked out at 2:30am to catch my flight at SF airport and perhaps it was thanks to the bags under my eyes and inability to stifle my yawns, but the front desk staff went above and beyond the expectations they'd set the day before. Since cabs don't park outside the hotel in the wee hours of the night, a staff member hailed one down for me and told the driver right where I needed to go, all while I was going through the checkout process. Thank you sir, for allowing me to avoid speaking full sentences at this absurd hour of the night. <br><br>Two things I wish I'd known before getting to the hotel... <br>1) the grand corner entrance is not the main entrance. Walk in this door and you're in the bar; the check-in desk is actually down the hall to the right, directly off Howard Street. <br>2) the elevator needs your key card to work. I stood there like the small-town Iowan that I've become, wondering if I wasn't pushing my floor's button hard enough. As it turns out, no the elevator is not broken. It just needs your room card. <br><br>While I am an aspiring old cat lady, that's not the reason for my Scrooge-like star rating. It really comes down to the cleanliness (my desk had a thick layer of dust and a dried ring of spilled coffee), the wrong card getting charged at checkout, and some of the stringiest wifi in all the land.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">OK, this review is just for their bar. \\xa0OK, just for one particular drink at this bar, the Floradora, a remarkably well balanced cocktail made with gin, raspberry syrup, lime juice and ginger beer. \\xa0Not cheap though.<br><br>Oh right, they also serve lamb belly pastrami - which is as rich and fatty and magical as you would hope. \\xa0Wash it down with the Floradora.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The W Hotel SF isn't just for out-of-town travelers to enjoy...because we live in North Beach, and we had the pleasure of checking the hotel out at a fantastic event called Yappy (or Yuppy!) Hour...a twist on Happy Hour for pups and their parents. \\xa0We were greeted with a grand pink carpet entrance - complete with photo opp area (for puparazzi!). \\xa0Natalia and her team did a greeT job of greeting guests and checking us in swiftly. A lovely collar vendor and the Bark For Life Fundraising team were on hand to educate and engage the audience. The DJ was spinning great dance jams that kept the mood upbeat and fun. \\xa0Passed apps for parents (and Scooby Snax for pups!) were served with panache...as were the signature cocktails. \\xa0For those who required other types of libations, there was also a bar. \\xa0The pooches also had their own drinkie bowl bar. \\xa0Koko (Chanel) enjoyed the chicken broth based martini the best. \\xa0We enjoyed our parting gift of a tricked out puppy swag bag (provided by Pawtrero Hill - organic dog food delivery service to hotel guests). \\xa0I am an SPG Gold member and never quite realized how much pet services the W Hotel had! \\xa0This was the most fun and educational event. \\xa0Koko had a blast, too! \\xa0I hope the W Hotel does this again! \\xa0Koko's followers are already interested in participating!</p>,\n",

Just down the road from Westfield if you need to get some shopping done, down the road from Target if you need random every purchases and about 0.7 miles away from the waterfront that takes you to all the touristy parts of SF. You're also far enough from the Tenderloin that you can feel pretty safe walking about on the streets unlike the hotel I stayed at the last time I was in SF.<br><br>The room was nice and pretty standard W. I do wish that instead of fully stocking the mini fridge with stuff I can buy, there would actually be some space for me to put leftovers in. With regards to staff, everyone was pretty courteous, but I will say I had a few odd experiences while here. I randomly had 4 toothbrushes dropped off in my room while I was out. I didn't ask for those, but didn't get charged either. I'm thinking they left it for the wrong room. Additionally the availability for the laundry didn't match what I was told when I actually tried to get it done with Whatever/Whenever.<br><br>I still haven't gotten my SPG points for my \"make a green choice\" I feel like I always have to follow up on this sort of thing and I am beginning to think I should just let them change the sheets or go for the voucher.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This place is unbelievable. I was visiting San Francisco on business and this is where I stayed. My first three thoughts upon arriving: hip. Cool. Huge. <br><br>My room felt more like a a hipsters apartment than just a hotel room. A corner nook for sharing champagne. Books on what to do in San Fran. Bottles of Bliss products in the bathroom. Say what?! Oh and the bed was one of the most comfortable things I've ever slept on. The room was quiet, clean and charming. <br><br>The fitness center was amazing. It was like working out in a night club. The bar in the lobby was always full of people who came for a good time. The staff was super helpful, polite and happy. <br><br>My only selfish and whiny complaint is this: my room had no view-no big deal, I headed up to to the 20th floor for a view. Except, the windows were all so dirty-which I'm sure is a hard task to keep up with being surrounded by all that ocean air. I went up to the 22nd floor: same thing. Not a huge deal and most people wouldn't even notice. The iphonographer in me HAD to get a picture from the top. I was in San Francisco!<br><br>I hope to see you again W! This small town girl enjoyed a trip to the big city.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've stayed at the Starwood W hotels many times and I am a member as well, I didn't understand the low rating for this location, but I unfortunate understand now!<br>The initial check was wonderful the reception was warm and welcoming. Unfortunately/fortunately the next morning I checked my hotel guest balance and there was $127 charged added to my room for valet?? I didn't drive here or have a vehicle parked at the hotel?? When I called the front desk I got the run around, and I've been waiting for Managment to call me back and explain their mistake, but I've yet to hear back and I called over 3 hours ago, and I've also yet to hear an apology they make it seem like I am lying!<br>Needles to say I will never stay here again if this is the policy to charge for valet even if you don't have a vehicle.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Pros:<br>- Great AAA rate that included parking.<br>- Valet was really professional. We had to stop by the hotel for 30 min once and they left our car out front.<br>- Free cider, hot chocolate and apples in the lobby.<br>- Convenient location.<br>- Comfy beds and Bliss products.<br><br>Cons:<br>- Its bar appears to be popular with the locals.<br>- Non-guests who wander up with you since they can't get anywhere without a key. The security system is a pro but people wandering into elevators with you and on to your floor with you is a con.<br>- Keyless/key problems. We had a late checkout and the key wouldn't work when we were back to checkout right before 4pm. Kind of a pain especially since we were staying on a high floor and had to run back downstairs twice.<br>- Sound proofing. We stayed in a corner room and there was a locked door to an adjoining room. We could hear almost everything that went on in that room, including sex.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">\"W San Francisco\" is a win. Upscale, trendy, post-modern and cosmopolitan. Because of the real estate crunch in the Financial District, however, the hotel has restrictions to space -- the lobby and corridors are a little thin and narrow. But still, it's sleek. The upstairs spa with massage and nails is quite deluxe. #decadence</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've never stayed at this W, but I've been to their bar many times.<br><br>Sure, drinks are pricey, but that is normally expected at a hotel bar. The decor is modern and the atmosphere like a chill lounge with music playing. I've been able to snag a table most times as I typically come here right after work (around 6pm) or after drinking somewhere nearby (round 8-10pm?).<br><br>Last time, I came for an event upstairs, but ordered from both the bar upstairs and down. We tried the Bulleit old fashioned ($13) and Bulleit manhattan ($13). Pretty standard drinks, there's something I love about the atmosphere and vibe of this place. It can seem a little snotty at first, but people really just come here to drink and have a good time.<br><br>The W is super convenient since it's close to work. But most importantly, it's fun. I always have a great time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Rooms were OK. For the price, you can get better. The bar downstairs is fun, it was very busy on a Friday night. I thought the room had a lot to be desired. Would go back, but only if I had points, or they were offering a deal.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I've been to SF now a few times for work - and stayed in a total of 3 different hotels. While I only spent one of those trips at the W - it was a pretty solid week.<br><br>As you might know - or maybe you don't - the lobby is basically like a nightclub. While I would normally find that annoying, it actually works really well here - and it's not bad to arrive from a long day at the office and be greeted with an upbeat party vibe. Especially when you have 100+ coworkers in town that are pretty out going folks.<br><br>The lobby area is full of little nooks and crannies to hang out in, pop open a laptop, sip your coffee, have a cocktail, catch up with a friend, or just hang out. The entire hotel is super trendy - and often times I feel like I'm not cool enough to be here. Be warned - this is a lifestyle brand and some of the \"bros\" you will run into from time to time are pretty d-baggy.<br><br>The staff is super nice, polite, dressed sharp and they keep the place pretty spotless. The rooms were spacious, the bed was super comfy and the bathrooms got the job done. It's a swanky spot - and possibly my favorite out of the 3 hotels I've stayed at in SF.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I like the hotel, and some of the staff. The gym is kinda small, but what really pissed me off was when I called from the SF airport to arrange a ride, and the receptionist told me to call an Uber. <br><br>I'm in the hotel now, and they claim that they arrange airport transportation -_-. Shuttles, town cars, limos...whatever you need. <br><br>This makes no sense.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Really nice place with great prices! A true mark of dedication to quality is that they change the floor mats of the elevators and entrances 3 times a day to say \"Good Morning, Afternoon, or Evening\"!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">First off, I stayed here on a business trip so I had no control over booking this hotel. Normally, I would stay in the cheapest crap motel I can find.. which I'm assuming is hard to find in the area of San Francisco I was staying in. \\xa0I gotta say, I really enjoyed my stay here! Maybe it's because I'm use to lesser quality accommodations. I mean, with that in mind, I still \\xa0know what nice is and I felt like this place was great! My room was very large and quite well stocked with snacks and drinks. The room d\\xe9cor was lovely and not dated like some ugly hotels I've stayed at. \\xa0You know the place... where the lobby is super fancy but the rooms have peeling wall paper and warped Walmart art work? I sound like I stay in some dumpy places... The art in the suite was actually quite nice! The bed was comfy and cozy, the tub was deep and the TV was big. My favourite thing about this hotel is the BLISS products they provide you. All W hotels must have partnered with BLISS to supply them with the mini toiletries they put in the rooms. I love BLISS products so I was super pumped to have the mini samples. They're marketing the smart way, because I went into my nearest Sephora and picked up a bottle of the body butter when I got home.<br>The lobby is lovely and each day they were giving out some free sample of something or another, a drink, some candy.. The waiting area is really nice too, with a huge glass fire place and bench seating sectioned off nicely so you're not sitting uncomfortable with strangers.<br>The front desk people are very helpful and friendly. They gave great directions and made sure I got a cab when it was time to leave.. Side note: is it just me, or are the cab drivers/Uber drives of San Francisco the nicest, most friendly in all North America?<br><br>I had a drink at the hotel bar, it was crazy busy most nights. The one time we did grab a drink some drunk creeper came over to our table and was super inappropriate, needless to say we didn't stick around there. Not the hotels fault in the least... that's a human race kinda problem. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay here and it was very central to great shopping, sights, restaurants and my work.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This is probably my least favorite Starwood hotel in San Francisco. It's not bad but I don't find it comfortable at all.<br><br>What I don't like:<br>- the sheets are crispy, like over starched, you're sleeping in plastic bags it makes so much noise<br>- the beds aren't that comfortable<br>- the only window dressings are shutters that don't block much light at all in the morning (no blackout drapes)<br>- the people saying here seem more rude, douchey and touristy<br><br>What I like:<br>- that color changing Buddha in the bedroom<br><br>Overall, this isn't terrible. I prefer the St. Francis. It's way more comfortable and classy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">for the price, this place is awful!!!!!! the sink leaks, no parking garage, the bathroom door wakes up my entire party with its shaking glass door. \\xa0 our menu wasn't even in our room <br><br>never again will I stay here!!! <br><br>2 stars for the comfortable bed and nice pillows</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My boyfriend have stayed here several times and truly have had the most magical time. Rooms are always great, clean and great views! Came here for my birthday and Anna from the front surprised us with a slice of cake wishing me a happy bday and it truly made me so happy!!! Thank you for the hospitality!!!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Beautiful modern hotel ...customer service is great but my two major downsides were one being the bed. I've never slept in a bed this uncomfortable in my life. I felt like my bones were all falling apart in the morning and the bathroom being a see through glass doesn't sit well with me. Other than that it's a very \"happening\" hotel with great friendly staff.!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed at the W this past weekend, and was shocked when I woke up covered in bug bites. I cannot believe that I paid $450+ for a tiny room that obviously is not properly cleaned or maintained. I emailed management after I left with pictures and have not received a response. I could've let it go if they had managed some semblance of customer service, but to not hear back at all from a hotel of this caliber is just completely unacceptable. <br><br>Stay away, you're better off at a hyatt, or hilton, or pretty much any other chain for that matter.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We stayed recently and thought the Hotel was nice. \\xa0The room was clean and quiet and the front desk and valet staff were courteous and helpful. \\xa0<br><br>One thing I did find somewhat tacky was the price tags on the items in the room - have a bottle of water, only $5.00, minibar with food and beverage items prominently displayed for purchase.<br><br>Good value for the price paid, just not really memorable.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Staying at the W was WOW... The service from everyone was exceptional and caring.<br>Great location ... walking distance to Moscone center, Yerba Buena Gardens and great restaurants... The hotel was perfect for our SF visit.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We just spent our 8th wedding anniversary at the W last weekend. \\xa0We were married in 2008 when same sex marriage became legal in California. \\xa0San Francisco has been our annual getaway to celebrate our anniversary ever since. \\xa0This year the W made our anniversary the most enjoyable to date!<br><br>Sara Hamza, our \"insider\" at the W, contacted us a few days before the trip and I told her about our anniversary. \\xa0When we checked in Sara had gotten us a great corner room with a view, a double upgrade from our original room. \\xa0And our first night when we got back to the room after dinner, Sara had surprised us with strawberries and chocolate and splits of white wine and \"Verve\" what a treat! \\xa0One of our pet peeves is the room being made up. \\xa0Every day we were there we would go to lunch and the room was made up like the day we checked in. And being gold members, we were given a late checkout, free internet and 2 comp drinks at the bar.<br><br>When we left we were in a rush to get to the airport and left behind a pair of shoes and a belt. \\xa0My partner contacted Sal in security who confirmed we had left these items. \\xa0Sal was professional and courteous and even sent the items back to us at the expense of the W.<br><br>We have stayed at dozens of hotels in San Francisco and the W tops all in service. \\xa0Kudos to Sara and Sal for their excellent customer service. \\xa0Can't want to go back next year!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My wife and I had a brief stay at the W because we were staying in San Francisco overnight after attending my company's Christmas party. \\xa0The staff was very friendly and the room was great. \\xa0We had an awesome view from our window. \\xa0Before the party we had dinner with friends at the restaurant downstairs and had a great meal. \\xa0And after the party we came back and had a great time hanging out at the XYZ bar. \\xa0Because of our short stay we did not have the opportunity to take advantage of all of the amenities. \\xa0The only downside was that parking at the hotel was $56 per day. Overall the W delivered a fantastic experience for our weekend gateway.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Notable people who have stayed at W San Francisco: Obama. Me. :D (Jk.) <br><br>I do sometimes wonder if Obama had as much trouble parking at W as I did, or if Secret Service takes care of that for him (come to think of it, when do you think the last time Obama parked his own car was? And do presidents get charged pet deposits for First Dog accommodations?)<br><br>In any case, it's easy to see why W would be the ideal place for a national political fundraising event. The customer service is phenomenal, and the lobby, open spaces and conference rooms are well-appointed and designed. As for my personal experience, here is a breakdown detailing all the essential amenities:<br><br>Parking: <br>W offers valet parking, but no self-parking. It being San Francisco (and on top of that, the financial district) there is no free parking in the vicinity, but there are nearby garages and lots that offer parking at lower rates. If you're being dropped of in front of the W and have bags on hand, you have about a 5 second window to hop out and dash into the lobby before you start clogging up the traffic on 3rd.<br><br>Transportation:<br>W offers free bike rentals to guests! It's first come first serve, but not a lot of guests utilize this service, and it's a great way to see all 49 square miles SF has to offer. <br><br>Location:<br>Amazeballs. W is located right next to the SFMOMA, Contemporary Jewish Museum, and Yerba Buena Gardens. The Ferry Building Marketplace and Union Square are also less than half a mile away.<br><br>Customer Service:<br>Also amazeballs. Every time I picked up the phone, the employees addressed me by my name, which felt personable and intimate. Service was always prompt and friendly. <br><br>Lobby/lounge:<br>Apparently, I'm a cantankerous old person, because the whole neon-lit nightclub vibe is not my jam. Neither is having people make eyes at you from 30 feet across vibrating carpet (get off my lawn, kids! *shakes fist*). I did however, enjoy complimentary coffee in the morning, fresh fruit and cucumber citrus water at all hours of the day, and warm apple cider in the evenings. <br><br>Decor:<br>The floral arrangements! Are those fresh blooms of ranunculus, orchids and baby Meyer lemons I see &amp; smell? I die!! Waiting on the elevator is no trial when you get to bury your face into these gorgeous bouquets. <br><br>Gym:<br>The gym is well-equipped, with filtered, oxygenated water dispenser, ear phones, fresh apples, Bliss Spa wipes, magazines, TV's, and clean towels. The decor is aesthetically similar to the lobby (think 2001: A Space Odyssey) which, in conjunction with heavy cardio, made me feel pretty disoriented. <br><br>Spa:<br>Bliss Spa operates out of the hotel, which makes booking an appointment an effortless treat. Plus, you're likely to walk away smelling like lemon verbena and roses. <br><br>Room:<br>My room had lovely bay windows with white wood shutters and a cushioned reading nook. The view of the SF Bay was spectacular, and the bed was soft and clean. The Japanese/Scandinavian-inspired minimalist design was easy on the eyes, but I felt that the bathroom (glass slab counter, small sink, little storage space for toiletries) was a little *too* minimalist for a 5-star hotel. While the room doesn't come equipped with a coffee machine, the hotel staff will bring you a Keurig --and plenty of pods-- upon request. <br><br>All in all, I enjoyed my business-oriented stay, but would probably stay somewhere else if I was in town for pleasure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love W hotels, whether AZ, SF, SD, or LA I always try and stay at one of their locations. Rooms are modern and comfortable, great ambiance and lounge area and usually in a great part of the town.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I had a corner room on the 15th floor with view overlooking Moscone Center. The corner nook seating area was cute for socializing and enjoying the nice view with friends, but made it impossible for someone to sleep on the couch because the benches were too small for someone to lay flat.<br><br>The music/DJ in the lobby makes the hotel pretty lively at night and a great meeting spot for friends to stop by and grab a drink. I had friends come over to my hotel twice during my stay to make use of the cute socializing corner nook in my room. :)<br><br>As a caveat, set your expectations that hotel rooms are smaller in San Francisco in general. I was upgraded to a suite, but it was much smaller than W suites I've been upgraded to in the past. I even called them to ask about it and they informed me about San Francisco's much smaller hotel rooms.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I came here to have a drink with my friend yesterday and we had a nice and quiet time. The bar downstairs is excellent looking with subtle neon lights all over the lounging area. People were sipping wine by the fire place, couches, bar, etc. it was a quiet environment with people talking in low voices and people are just getting off of work and ready to have a drink.<br><br>We went upstairs to the lounging area which was empty because it had just opened when we arrived. The drinks are pretty pricey ($8 a bottle!!) which is a turn off but hey, it's SF and we're sipping at the W right?! <br><br>We sat inside one of the private area with couch seating and nice tables. We had a typical lounge session with two Anchor Steams. We had a great time just talking about life and other stuff over beers which was perfect for the setting. <br><br>The W in SF is okay, it's not flashy whatsoever. I kind of expected a bit more of a sophisticated-fun, exotic environment. Then again we came early in the day which isn't a good way to review the W because this hotel is known for its nightlife and midnight vibes. I'll have to come back though!</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">One would expect excellence at these rates, however their process and their staff are not up to par at all. \\xa0Even at a corporate group rate, it cost between $600 and $780 / night for an average room with 2 queens. \\xa0When I checked in, I was informed by the hotel that I had to provide a credit card for up to $200 in incidentals. \\xa0I provided a personal credit card since I switched wallets and forgot my corporate card at home. <br><br>I signed for / authorized up to $200, then the hotel immediately billed $1,300. (Who pre-bills for the room, the incidentals you don't use, and the \"Free Wifi\" that apparently isn't free?) \\xa0I went to Starbucks to get a coffee and learned my card had been disabled because my credit card company thought fraud had taken place. I returned to the hotel and spoke to the manager, Tiffany, who said she would resolve this, however she was not able to fix it. Meantime, I asked my husband if he would call in my corporate credit card info from home but the hotel said they could not accept that via phone and they emailed him a code to use in their secure portal, however their portal DOESN'T WORK. \\xa0This wasted at least 15 minutes of my time, about 25 minutes of his time (trying to give the W my corporate card info) PLUS an additional 20 minutes with our credit card company to try to un-do the mess, however they said I had to do it. I was working long hours at the conference and didn't have time to call my credit card company until the following Monday when I had the 15-20 minutes needed to resolve it.<br><br>After I checked out I went home, got my corporate card, called the hotel back, spoke to the new manager on duty, Ricardo, and explained the whole thing to him, and he said the only way I could switch the charge to my corporate card was to use their portal THAT DID NOT WORK. \\xa0Their attitudes were terrible - they implied we somehow were not putting the code in correctly during the 15 minutes allowed, yet we tried repeatedly and did everything as directed. It simply DOES NOT WORK. Finally Ricardo told me that \"if I hurry\" I could use their secure fax number, so I had to excuse myself from a meeting at work, print out a form, fill it out, scan it, then e-fax it to their secure fax number before their accounting person left at 4:45. I wasted at least 45 more minutes on this. Then a week later, I got a very lame email from manager Tiffany recapping my painful experience and ending her \"deeper explanation\" with: \"Please let me know if there is anything we can do to further assist you.\" She should have provided me with some Starwood points or something to make me feel more loyal, or at least make the situation less painful. Her job title is: WELCOME OFFICE TALENT COACH / W SAN FRANCISCO. \\xa0Good Grief!<br><br>I felt anything BUT welcome from the people who manage this hotel. \\xa0They have Neiman Marcus prices without the Nordstrom customer service and their rooms are \"Meh.\" Food is OK but a little pricey. \\xa0So, steer clear of this hotel if you like quality and value.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

The bathrooms, closets, etc. are more motel-like feeling than I would have expected. The light up mirror in the room didn't work and we had no full-length mirror. Getting dressed for a party, we had to go down the hall to the big mirror by the elevators to check our outfilts. We had reserved 2 adjacent rooms since we had a babysitter watching the kids and on check-in at 3 pm were told the second room was not clean and we would have to take rooms 16 floors apart. Had to press the front desk to get someone up to clean the reserved room which had been sitting empty all afternoon. Room service charges were not correct on check out and required a call to the hotel to straighten out. While not rude, the staff just has a pretty disinterested attitude and gave me the vibe that maybe it isn't a great place to work.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I came here for my birthday and consider to that, they prepared a nice little gift for me and i was very surprised and happy about that! <br><br>The entire brand and vibe is absolutely outstanding and that was exactly what i was looking for! Young, energetic, chill, stylish.. \\xa0Those are just a few points what makes the hotel so special, compared to grand hotels etc.<br>I had a big corner room with city view and a king size bed in the 18th floor! Absolutely amazing! I can't remember last time I slept so good in a bed. It's so comfortable!<br><br>I totally recommend this hotel and I would give 6 stars if that would be possible. <br><br>A big thank you to the W Hotelteam (especially to the concierge/insider) for making my birthday so special and memorable!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Check-in was a breeze, gentlemen who took care of us was polite and professional. I wasn't thinking much of it but I asked if there were any free upgrades since it was my b-day weekend and surprisingly they provided us with a larger room and with a nice view :) Later on after me lady and I went into our room we got some treats and a birthday note from the staff (girlfriend called beforehand about my birthday). All of this made our stay at the W extra special and since this was our 1st time in San Francisco it definitely made it memorable. Thank you to the W staff!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Swanky spot to stay . Great location and great views of the bay bridge if you get higher floor room and corner room. Valet parking is kinda a bear, you better have a smaller vehicle.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Not much to say about this beautiful trendy place that has not already been said before.<br><br>The Downstairs is always hoppin' with young people drinking and there is always a dj. I thought I was at home in Vegas for a second when we walked in.<br><br>We loved our 28th floor corner room facing the Bay Bridge and right above the MOMA. I wish they would clean their windows because it would make a better view.<br><br>The duel window seats and the plantation window shutters just like home, were my two fav things about the room, very relaxing. <br><br>They have a pillow menu and we were sent up Tempur pillows. It's always nice to have BLISS products in the room also. The little lemon lotion came in handy for walking around town/purse use. <br><br>The W lost a star due to the disgusting room service. Thank goodness we never ate at TRACE if that's the kitchen the crap came from. Nasty veggie burger, small limp fries, slow service, and not so fresh fruit. The only thing that was good were the two large bottles of Smart Water. I called down to have them pick up the burger plate immediately and they were super kind and comped the whole service.<br><br>I think it's cute that they have a pet room service dining menu. Maybe that food is better than their human food.......<br><br>We forgot sunscreen for the Giants game and it was crazy hot sun and 80+ degree seasonally odd weather and the lady downstairs sent two travel sized bottles to our room.

I believe around the block. <br><br>We will def stay at the W again anytime our fav Joie de Vivre location is booked and *almost* two thumbs up!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">5 stars for the staff.<br>3 stars for the hotel.<br><br>The W San Francisco is one of the swankier SPG hotels in the area, with its modern, upscale vibe infused into each part of its property. \\xa0<br><br>This was my first stay at the W San Francisco, having been at several of the other SPG properties in the area, and after hopping around a few rooms early on in my stay from a Fabulous Room to a Mega Room, it dawned on me how small these rooms were - all around 300-400 sq ft. \\xa0I don't think this is too out of the ordinary compared to the other W's in major cities I've stayed at (e.g., Chicago, NYC), but it still blows my mind that a \"Mega Room\" (the biggest room outside of the suites) only comes out to about 400 sq. ft.<br><br>In any case, after a few mishaps with my rooms early on, the front desk staff and manager (Melanie and Ricardo, I believe) were extremely accommodating and allowed me to stay in the Extreme Wow Suite for my 1 night. \\xa0Extreme Wow is a great name to call it - a huge lounge area, 2 bathrooms, couches, tables, etc., provided an amazing start to the night before going out. \\xa0Although I know that this is a rare occasion, I still want to let it be known that this staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was at their standards.<br><br>Personally, I think the W SF is best for special occasions, but their staff and bar are worth checking out at least once if you're in the area and want to have a good time. \\xa0This place is also good if you like the W line of hotels in general and want that type of vibe throughout your stay in the City.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Me and girlfriend had a great stay at the W. Everyone was extremely nice and rooms where very clean. Even let us keep our the car in valet after check out while we went to a Giants game. Matt really stood out to me when he brought out our bags. He was just so genuine and friendly he even had our bags packed in the car ready for us! Thank you so much!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Convenienlty located in downtown San Francisco near the Moscone Convention Center where all the tech conferences are held, this hotel is super chic and modern with an upscale vibe. This hotel houses a popular XYZ bar with live DJ's performing every night. The hotel bed was super comfortable and I got a great views of the city and there was a cool purple Buddha night light. Had breakfast in the Trace restaurant and it was very good. Got a rate of $279 per night which was more than I spent for my hotel in Vegas that had way more amenities but the location was a must. The gym had all new equipment and was pretty nice. The Hotel room was large with a built in desk. Would come back again! Free Wi-Fi included, no free parking.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When planning my trip with my boyfriend to San Francisco for his birthday, I was floored by how amazing this hotel looked and the price for the hotel. I went through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Booking.com</a> and I definitely got bang for my buck, which I still agree with after my stay at the W San Francisco.<br><br>We entered the hotel at about 8:40 PM at night because of our delayed flight. I was a little thrown off with the ambience in the lobby. I knew going into the hotel that it had a young, hip, vibe, but if you're a little more of an old soul at heart and wish to decompress after a delayed flight and the plight of traveling (such as myself), just be forewarned that the lobby tends to get a bit \"bumping\" from 8:00 PM onwards. The concierge was very helpful and he made sure that he found a room with a king size bed for us, and was willing to make sure we got an upgrade if no such room was available without an extra charge to us. He told me about becoming an SPG member and how I can get free Wi-Fi. He said it will look like you will be charged but it will wipe out from your bill once you check out. (The charge is currently on my account so I'll update you all to confirm that what he said is still the case once all the charges have cleared).<br><br>My boyfriend and I then got our room keys and proceeded to our room. We were so amazed when we opened the door! It was exactly like the pictures entailed. Everything was super clean and crisp and we had such an amazing view of the city. I loved the ambience in our room, from the little buddha figurine to the foot massager at the desk. The complimentary water was a nice touch, along with travel books for tourists like me to peruse through. Just the level of detail was great. We then proceeded to unpack our clothes and with that, I will say that the only downside was there wasn't a great shelving area for our clothes within the closet, although there was one by the bed (I prefer shelves and drawers to a hanging closet). I will say that the bed in the room felt like a slice of heaven. It was very comfortable and the room was always kept at a good temperature. <br><br>The only major downsides include the Wi-Fi connection, which was quite awful. I wanted to do some research on my iPad and always found myself getting kicked off the connection every 10 or so minutes, and the connection I was on was very slow. Another downside was the noise level that could be heard from the halls. There were definitely some party people staying in nearby rooms, but when they were in the halls and talking, it reverberated in our room, which was to the point that I was very close to calling concierge to complain.<br><br>I enjoyed my stay at W San Francisco overall. I loved the convenience of the location and there is definitely a lot to do as a tourist. The ambience and cleanliness coupled with the friendliness of the staff made the stay extremely enjoyable. I would keep a lookout for deals when looking at this hotel. Definitely would stay again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">It is a nice, expensive hotel very conveniently located. If you get a room on a higher floor, you'll get a decent view &amp; a cosy padded bench by the window which will give you the option of reading/talking on the phone/working with a view. <br>I did not like that I had to pay for my water (come on! A $400/night should cover, no?) and was unpleasantly surprised by the lacking room service. But most disappointing was the bar downstairs. Wow! It feels slimy, with questionable women &amp; overall audience lacking. Be ready to dart straight through and up to your room.<br><br>Bonus: coffee downstairs was surprisingly excellent.</br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">tl;dr: San Francisco is home to many, many high-quality hotels. Unfortunately, I can no longer count The W as being one of them. Your money will be better spent almost anywhere else.<br><br>A few weeks ago my partner and I needed a last minute room. I made a reservation for one night in a Wonderful Room w/King Bed. $300/night ($349.59 inc tax). I'm a member of an entrepreneurial group that provides a benefit at The W (two \"welcome\" drink vouchers + wifi), so also included the promo code.<br><br>The reservation was made Saturday at ~10:30pm, we were at the hotel by 11:00pm. There was one other couple in front of us in reception, and no one behind the desks. After ~5 minutes we went over to a security guard and said that we needed to check in... he looked at us, didn't say a word, then turned around and walked away.<br><br>After another ~5 minutes of sharing puzzled looks, two employees came out from the back room and walked over to the checkin desks. The couple in front of us went over to William (we learned his name later), and we began walking over to the other desk, manned by an asian fellow. As we were approaching, a woman came in from the street and cut in front of us. I said \"excuse us, we've been waiting a long time\". The asian fellow waved us away, turning his attention back to the woman.<br><br>Another ~5 minutes and Willam called us over. We talked briefly about our experience so far, and then he began checking us in. He said \"Wonderful Room with two full size beds\".<br><br>Wait, what? We told him we had a reservation for a king bed, he said they didn't have any available.<br><br>To paraphrase Seinfeld, apparently The W knows how to take a reservation, they just don't know how to *hold* the reservation. So if staying in the room you've reserved is at all important to you, for that reason alone you may want to consider another hotel.<br><br>William offered us a $75 honor bar credit, handed us our key, and off we went. (I later realized we never received our drink vouchers)<br><br>First impression of the room; unimpressed. It was muggy, dark. A general dingy feel. I turned on the AC (which didn't make much of an impact), showered, put on a clean pair of pants, sat down on one of the chairs... and discovered there was some sort of sticky syrup on the cushion. That was my only change of pants. Fantastic.<br><br>It was at this point we discovered the walls were paper-thin; the couple in the next room began a loud, passionate lovemaking session. We called down to the front desk and spoke with William. He said there were no other rooms but that he would speak with his manager first thing in the morning and that they'd \"make this right\".<br><br>Knowing we had a credit, we corked a bottle of wine, started a movie, and tried to make the best of a bad situation.<br><br>The room and experience eventually got the better of us and we decided to go to another hotel. We packed up, took one iced tea from the honor bar, and went down to reception to check out... and no one was there. We went back up to the room, left the keys on the desk, and left. We were there for approximately ~4 hours.<br><br>I expected a call from William's manager sometime Monday to \"make things right\". No call, but I did receive a survey from The W's General Manager, Roger Huldi. I went into detail about the whole experience and thought he might reach out to me for more information, or to at the very least apologize. No call.<br><br>Then on Tuesday I see the charge on my AmEx... $482.70. WTF?!?<br><br>I immediately called Roger. He was unavailable, so I told his secretary that I had filled out the survey and asked her to have Roger look it over and call me back.<br><br>Later that day, I got a call. I fully expected Roger to have reviewed the survey, perhaps spoken with William. But no, I had to recount the entire stay. He did apologize and asked what I would like him to do. I said \"first, I would like to know why I was charged an extra ~$130\". He said he would check into it and call me back.<br><br>He called a few hours later. To his credit, the first thing he said was that he was going to refund the room. Unfortunately the good vibes stop there. \\xa0He said the ~$130 was for the honor bar. I told him that William had given us a $75 credit, exactly what we took (probably totaled ~$40), and asked where the other ~$90 came from. He didn't know (starting to see a pattern here), and said he would call me back.<br><br>He called a few hours later and said that in addition to the bottle of wine and tea, we had taken a bottle of Maker's Mark ($90???). I told him that was a mistake and that I don't drink whiskey (makes me violently ill). <br><br>He told me I was lying.<br><br>Not knowing what to do, I asked about William's $75 credit. He said \"you've gotten enough, we're not going to honor that\".<br><br>This account has in no way been exaggerated. I'm no stranger to Starwood Hotels, but this experience has been singularly enlightening, and I don't expect I'll be staying with them in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Aside from the douchy night crowd that fills the first floor of this hotel on Friday and Saturday nights, my stay at the W was fabulous! <br><br>We were upgraded to a corner suite when we had checked into the W late on a Friday night!!! A large comfy King sized bed with probably the best hotel pillows around, spacious bathroom, full stocked snack bar and fridge, and excellent Bliss products everywhere! Not only were they in the bathroom, the Spa and the Tidy Towels for the gym too. For whatever reason, the gym was outside on a terrace which they had covered with clear tarp. It was small, but it did the job for my stay that weekend. It had a few ellipticals, two bike machines and five treadmills, all which were fairly new. The pluses though were the towels, ample local magazine, earplugs and complimentary bowl of Granny Smith apples! Could not have asked for better concierge and front door service. <br><br>It the little things that put them at 5.0 stars for me, like change of elevator rugs that said \"Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening\" The infused water at the front desk, the ATM so conveniently located on the 2nd floor! <br><br>If i'm ever in SF again, i will definitely return.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here for a weekend, in town for the 2015 Nike Women's Half Marathon. This place is located in the south Market area aka SoMa. The W Hotel is a very modern, trendy, hipster place. They have Bliss bath products!! They are close to the BART station at Union Square and a lot of other runners also stayed at this place for the Nike Half. I stayed in their Wonderful room with double beds, my view was the side of another building. The beds were small but then again I am a tall person.<br><br>I don't have any major complaints about this place because they were very kind and helpful. I do have to warn you that check out time is 12 pm so if you're coming in late from the race or if you took the shuttle bus from the race, you might get automatically locked out of your room. That happened to me but I was able to talk to the front desk people and they were able to unlock the room for us. They didn't charge extra for late check out but we were only 1/2 hr late for check out, I even called to ask if it was ok and they said it was fine.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">One of the better W's I've stayed at as a business traveler. \\xa0The rooms are very spacious, especially the corner ones. \\xa0The decal is very new and clean. \\xa0Lobby receptionists are very friendly. \\xa0They also have folks that will stand outside on the street to wave down cabs for you so you don't have to stand in the cold. <br><br>Downside of the W is the bathroom doors are opaque and not very soundproof. \\xa0This shouldn't be an issue unless you are rooming with someone that you're not that comfortable with.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So far, 1000% 5 stars...where are the extra star buttons for the businesses that literally go the extra mile?l! They go above and beyond! A very big thank you to Gerard and the wonderful man/valet who is making sure my car stays safe during my stay. :) Quick tip: valet is before you turn onto 3rd street...almost a block before and a little hard to see. If you miss it, you can make an easy loop, back around. I was greeted with smiles and friendliness that really made me feel welcomed. I was even offered some delicious fruit infused water while I checked in and my bags were collected by Gerard. Check in was quick, easy, welcoming, informative and all around fabulous. I wish I could remember the check in persons name. Everyone so far has been friendly, welcoming and helpful! My entire room/amenities/in room bar/munchies box/light switches and the safe was shown and explained to me and even some tips for my stay were offered. :)) I am beyond pleased! My room is on the 27th floor, overlooking the bay bridge and city...GORGEOUS! This room is called the fabulous room and yes, the name is perfffff! Love it!! The bed is so comfy, I want to crawl in it right now! I will be sleeping in heaven tonight. :)) Yayyy! This is the first time staying at the W and I have heard some really great things....now I get to experience it! :)) Plus 3 floors of halloween fun tonight! Thank you for being so awesome W!!!</p>,\n",

I only stayed one night but it was great.<br><br>First, the essentials - the bed was very comfy, the room was clean, the bathroom was spacious and had awesome Bliss products. I was there on a weeknight so it was very quiet - I never heard anything in the rooms next to me so I slept great.<br><br>The overall design details are great. Everything was thought of from the pillows on the bed to the do not disturb sign. The room definitely stood out against other regular hotels. \\xa0<br><br>This hotel may have spoiled me for other hotels now.

       " <p lang=\"en\">We happen to come on Chinese New Year and got stuck in the worst traffic ever on the way to this hotel. It took us 45 minutes to get to the hotel after having lunch in fisherman's wharf. My boyfriend was in a bad mood and the entire traffic situation was destroying our day- almost. <br><br>We did a hotel tonight deal and got a room for $300 before tax... But since we didn't check in until 6pm, the last room available was one with 2 twin beds. We were not happy but we made a joke about it and with hotel tonight's policy we could not get a refund. <br><br>We got a room on the 28th floor and it was breathtaking- it made up for the 2 twin beds. We cuddle so much we really didn't notice a huge difference with a king vs two twin bed room- maybe it's just because we are in love and sleep so closely together always. The bellman were really accommodating and sympathetic about the traffic situation. We actually decided to stay in and we ordered room service from trace- (the restaurant inside the W) it wasn't amazing but definitely decent and we were satisfied. <br><br>My boyfriend wanted to go smoke a cigarette so I came downstairs and after coming back inside with him we ended up using the drink tickets and chilling at the multiple bars on the main floor and upstairs. I felt a little bit like I was in Hollywood. I think that is a pretty impressive compliment to the W of San Francisco because I am a local in Hollywood and I have gotten drinks and stayed at almost all the top rated hotels in Los Angeles. (I have so many reviews to do) We didn't really need to go out and find a cool bar in the area because we were staying at such a happening location. <br><br>I have been out in San Francisco because my sister lives here so I know what the lounges/bars are like here. I highly recommend the W San Fran because we overall had an awesome experience. I have been to both the Westwood and Hollywood locations for dinner/drinks/pool/room and I think SF is doing a great job for the price and location. I would stay here again. Next time with a king size bed:)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">we went on Memorial weekend for 2 nights. During 2 nights we had to change our room 3 times!! At the beginning when made a reservation we asked for room with view in upper level, they gave us a room which had a common door with the next room and at after midnight a group of people arrived and woke us up even hotel security couldn't make them to calm down so they moved us to an other room. Next day we woke up and the view we had was a wall from the window so again we asked and this time we got a better room. we will be back cause even was horrible to change a room 3 times for 2 nights. They tried to make us satisfied and happy for our staying in the hotel and we liked the ambiance and food.</p>,\n",

We had very noisy elevator sounds and other annoying noises in the morning. <br>Room was very small. Comfortable bed. Nice mini bar. Nice bathroom. Downstairs lounge was nice and had drinks one night. Staff was very friendly. We wish we would have asked for a different room. We like the location. We might give it another chance but will ask for a room on a higher floor for a view.</br></p>,\n",

I contacted front desk and they offered me a new room. After going to the new room, it felt very small and claustrophobic. I contacted the front desk again and they said they would have a manger contact me.

Checkout is at noon but I was able to leave my bags and car until past 6pm while I spent the day in the city. <br><br>My one main complaint is that their sheets are made of a very odd, non-ventilating material, which were uncomfortable to sleep in.</br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I thought W hotels were supposed to be super nice? This place is ok. The lobby and common areas are super sleek and modern, but the rest of the hotel is clearly repurposed / retrofitted from whatever this building used to be. It just doesn't feel natural or really fit. <br><br>The rooms are nice, with the same feel of slapping some super modern fixtures in a room that's 50 years old. Biggest issue here is the closet. When I tell you it was not more than 6 inches wide, I am not exaggerating. If you have more than 3 items to hang, it won't fit. <br><br>Other main complaint was a lack of knowledge of the staff. We were there for a wedding, and none of the staff had any information at all about the provided transportation or other details. <br><br>Price was reasonable ($160ish) for the location and was easily accessed from the airport by mass transit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">2/5.. Now let me explain because there was so much potential to have a 5 star experience. <br><br>Check in. I pulled up at the door in my Jeep full of luggage. The Bell Hop Standing there did not greet me, he pulled out a yellow ticket to valet the car. I asked if I could simply have my luggage brought in and chaeck-in. He told me that he will charge me for as long as they watch my car. Parking at the W is 0-2 hours $26 dollars. So basically to checkin I would have to pay $26 the way he explained it. I ended up parking in a no parking zone. I checked in an then took the Bell Hops cart loaded my luggage myself. This was done all in front of the Bell Hop/valet staff. All the way to the point where another customer held the door for me! \\xa0<br><br>Pro Tip: \\xa0Find free parking a little outside the city and park your car there then a taxi back I paid $12 there &amp; back to my car from the time I arrived to leaving. Better then the hotel price of $66 per night! <br><br>Recovery.. As I'm carting my own luggage down the hall to the elevator the lady at the concierge starts freaking out asking why am I lugging my own luggage to my room and she tried to stop me stating that \"someone else should be doing this\". I simply thanked her for her hospitality and kept going. <br><br>The moment I got into the elevator a Bell Hop Jumped in apologizing &amp; asking what room I'm in and of course he's here to help. In which he 100% did. He was very nice and friendly. <br><br>THE ROOM.<br><br>I stayed near the top of the hotel and the room was wonderful. Great design &amp; fantastic furniture and an ok view. One thing to note is the train. It is very very loud at night. you will notice it if your on that side of the building. The bathroom was half way there. Reason why I say half is because it still had an outdated tub &amp; not a nice stand up shower. The hotel provided soaps are dreamy. The room as a nice large desk with all the charging ports you can ever dream of as well bluetooth speaker &amp; comfortable bed .<br><br>LATE NIGHT ROOM SERVICE <br><br>Ordered a burger for $17 came with fries that were cold. Hotel did a incredible job fixing this mistake they were very good about finding a solution! \\xa0Total cost was $29 then I tipped the guy $5 bucks for having to work late! once again Incredible experience. <br><br>CHECK OUT <br><br>This was by far the worst experience. This is were the W took an L. When checking out I asked to split the charges on two cards. I thought this would be an easy experience however the staff member made me feel like I was causing a major pain. As I'm trying to calculate how much to put on each card he kept on asking \"How much\" repeatedly while waiving my card in front of me even after I told him that I'm checking right now. Following that ordeal, once I figured it out my card did not auto full all of my information so I ended up having to pay cash which means using there lobby ATM with there lovely $4 charge. <br><br>Sure enough I carted my luggage to the front door and the Bell Hop said it was his time and took off &amp; that someone will be there to help load my taxi. Well once again. That person loading the taxi was me. <br><br>Remember the W City Center is a wonderful environment, Great Space. I would recommend the hotel to a person who does not travel a lot and has never stayed at a W hotel before. It was just not at the standard I have experienced at any other W Hotel. \\xa0They just fell short &amp; took the L.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

I do want to add there is a lot of noise (street traffic). \\xa0i guess everyone in the area feels the need to hold their car horn down for 30 seconds at a time.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I made reservations through a third party a few days prior with no problems. We arrived earlier than check in time. As we walked in the hotel it looked very upscale and more for business occasion. (FANCY and VERY ELEGANT). For the amount we payed I really didn't think it were going to be this nice! As we checked in with Bethany she was very hospitable with me. Since we had an early arrival she assured us that we would be able to leave our luggage's and they would be waiting for us when we returned. \\xa0I had a couple questions for her and she was very patient and answered all my needs. I left feeling comfortable, that we would be taken care of. During our stay everything was pleasant. They conveniently left beverages and snacks at no additional cost. The rooms very kept nice and clean. I even had the opportunity to go to the gym; the equipment were new and had towel services. Everything was a wonderful and had an amazing experience.</p>,\n",

I called the front desk and they were mortified and profusely apologetic. \\xa0They immediately sent someone up with keys to a different room - an upgrade to a massive room. \\xa0No questions or BS. \\xa0We made a mistake, that's not good, here is how we will take care of you. \\xa0<br><br>I left the W very happy. \\xa0There is a lot that businesses could learn here from my experience.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I have had the pleasure of staying at several W hotels, both in the US and internationally. Out of all of those experiences, the one at W Chicago - City Center was by far the worst. While not terrible in itself, it is far below the level of quality you would expect from the W chain or other hotels in a similar price range. The specifics on what I disliked may seem nitpicky, but when you are paying over $300/night you should not have any nits to pick.<br><br>First of all, the lobby looks like it has seen better days. It was far from spotless. Things like the water dispenser being empty, scuff marks everywhere, give you a first impression of \"scruffiness\" rather than \"chique\".<br><br>Secondly, the rooms were very disappointing. Apart from having the unfortunate combination of being the smallest yet most expensive of all the rooms we have seen in Chicago hotels, they were also of uniquely bad design. For example, the bathroom had no towel racks, so you had to improvise on where to keep them. The counter space next to the sink had enough space for toothbrushes, but not much else. The bathroom door would not close properly. There was no full length mirror, which gets annoying pretty quick when two people are trying to dress up for a wedding.<br><br>Finally, the service was very variable. Most importantly, this hotel does not provide free Wi-Fi for its guests (but there is free Wi-Fi in the lobby, though it forces you to take 15 minute breaks every hour). Thankfully, my wife was in a rewards program for the hotel, which gave us free Wi-Fi, but if this had been my first experience with the chain it would have put me off it for good. It's 2016, Wi-Fi is more a utility than an amenity. There were no robes provided in the room. They did let us check in early, which was very nice. However, they front desk staff initially told us we could check out at 3 PM instead of 12 PM for a $50 fee, which later turned out to be $100. There was also no concierge or any other front end staff at 4 AM.<br><br>The location is great. However, there are many hotels in the area in this price range that provide a better experience. I will not be staying in this hotel again.<br><br>In summary, this hotel provides a budget experience for a premium price.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Converted from an old bank, the rooms leave much to be desired. \\xa0Yes, the lobby is visual appealing and cozy but once beyond that, there is not much else. \\xa0Low ceilings. \\xa0Dirty windows. \\xa0Location wise I am a fan but unless there was a great deal, I wouldn't choose to stay here.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When I first checked in, they (the W Hotel) gave me an occupied room. By occupied, I mean, shoes on the ground, jeans on the carpet and MacBook Pro sitting on the desk!! <br><br>Granted, the room was decent size and roomie. I went down to the front desk to switch rooms and they gave me room that was probably 10 x 7. If I laid on the bed in a superman position across the bed, there would be able 1/2 an inch from my hand and feet to the wall. The room was so small, that I could not even open the storage / Refrigerator door (i took a video). The bathroom had a sliding door because there was no room for a door to swing open.<br><br>Onto the bathroom....I was in the bathroom and when I stood up from the toilet, my forehead hit the wall. This is how small the bathroom is. When I got out of the shower, I literally has to \"shimmy\" out into the room, because there was no room to dry off in the bathroom.<br><br>Onto the bed...I took off the comforter to check the sheets and low and behold, stains all over the sheets. They were brown, so I don't know if it was dried blood of feces. Either way, it was absolutely disgusting. So i slept in sort of a planking position trying not to touch anything<br><br>Then in the morning, after my shower, I noticed something on the towels....<br><br>THERE WERE BUGS ON THE TOWELS! Literally BUGS!<br><br>I told the front desk at my 6am check out that this was the most awful experience I have ever had. <br><br>The icing on my experience, the W would not do anything more than four free drink tickets. <br><br>I would stay far far far FAR away from this hotel. The Marriot across the street looks much nicer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Great hotel. AWFUL customer service. <br><br>My room was charged to the wrong card putting my debit account that was meant only for incidentals into the negatives. <br><br>I called the front desk and was given a lot of attitude with no apologetic tone. Trevor at the desk then decided to hang up on me instead of trying to resolve the issue or at least acting empathetic. Instead he turned it on me as if I was at fault. <br><br>I also was never asked if I needed assistance with my bags upon arrival. <br><br>Certainly not the quality other W hotels offer. Plenty of top notch hotels in Chicago. <br><br>Might as well avoid this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed at this hotel last August while visiting Chicago for a convention. As usual, I waited until the last minute to make travel arrangements and \\xa0this hotel was the closest one that had availability. The location of the hotel is excellent, I barely needed my rental car as everything was in walking distance. By the way, rent a car only if absolutely necessary. Valet parking was about $65 per night, which is typical in large major cities. Check in was easy. There was long line but it moved fast, and the front desk staff were courteous. The rooms are VERY small. I was there by myself and felt very cramped. <br>My stay was okay but I'm just not a fan of W hotels. I can't put my finger on it but everyone there just acts too cool for school. The whole concept just seems too hipster for me. I probably will not return again.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When I lived in Chicago I got to check this hotel out. Having stayed at the Lakeshore location several times (no clue why) I kept hearing from staff that this was more of a business hotel. I get why they say that as the Lakeshore location is closer to the \"action\" and their living room/bar area is more popular. BUT, this location's lobby is gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous! BUT, (yup another but in capitals) it's empty! They use the space for nothing! Just people sitting around here and there. This lobby would make a perfect bar/lounge. I have no clue why this hotel is so boring, they have all the ambiance they need!<br><br>Rooms are small, views are horrible (it's a view of the courtyard aka the buildings behind you or the other side of the building) limited natural light and small hallways. <br><br>This hotel has so much potential. They should make this hotel a bit more \"W\". Only reason I choose to stay at the W on Lakeshore is because of the location and the downstairs vibe. But this W is way cleaner than the Lakeshore location.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This review is primarily or the meeting and event space at the W City Center. It is conveniently located in the Loop, right across from the JW Marriott in fact, so no problem getting a cab right outside the door. The event I attended was held on the meeting room on the Plateau level which was a bit tricky to locate..fyi..elevators are at the back of the lobby. Fortunately the concierge/check in person was knowledgeable. The passed appetizers were top-notch, especially the one with brie and short rib, and I couldn't believe the variety, as there were new and different items--mini eggrolls, crab cakes, bruschettas, constantly being circulated. The white wine was good and the event staff were phenomenal. There weren't very many restrooms on that floor, so I probably should have gone back to the first level.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We stayed here for one night over the weekend. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The room was small (I mean small like two people would run into each other every other second) and smelled funny (the kinda funny that makes you wonder if your travel partner has farting issues but then you think it cannot take that long so it should be the room). The sound proofing of the rooms were aweful; multiple time during the night I woke up thinking someone's in the room only to realize that they're just walking in the hallway.<br>Long story short, save yourself some money and book a hotel further from downtown and cab into downtown.</br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Zero stars. Yet another Chicago hotel I am blacklisting with my admin. As a New Yorker i sleep through normal city noises. Yet I am writing this at 5:30am in the morning because I was just awaken by what appears to chainsaw sounds in the alley my windows are overlooking. I seriously think they're sawing metals right outside my window. The front desk informs me they \"don't control the noise outside of our hotel\". Well you do control your windows, which could've been modern sound proof packs rather than 100 years old double-hungs if your city noise ordnance allows for such activities this early in the morning (thank god it is 60 degrees outside, the wind goes right through them) and you also can control your customer service skills. <br><br>The rooms are also dated, tiny and crappy. Bliss soap does not make up for this. Avoid.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Located right in the middle of the Chicago loop and close to a sea of restaurants, attractions and transportation, W Chicago City Center is about as good as it gets for anyone visiting Chicago.<br><br>The hotel definitely has more of a lounge vibe than most W hotels, thus immediately upon walking in, you get a burst of energy to go out and do something. <br><br>The rooms have clearly been updated with modern touches to an otherwise older hotel. My room was spacious, clean and like all W beds, it was awesome. The one thing I would change is the lack of light in the room. Given that the window was in the corner of the room, it was consistently dark through out the day.<br><br>The bar in the lobby was awesome and made for a great place to grab some good cocktails before heading out. It also turns into a mini club scene at night, so you can even make a night of it and have a good time.<br><br>This hotel is a top option for staying in a Chicago in my opinion, especially if you're a first time visitor. It's walking distance to magnificent mile, the bean, willis tower, public trains and the Amtrak station. You can literally walk out your hotel and have options to go anywhere in the city. It's not newest W in the world, but it's still very nice and has that W attractiveness that the brand has come to be known for. Great option!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love W Hotels! Sexy, chic, and trendy hotel. The room could have been better, but I understand that this place was remodeled. Staff was great though.

       " <p lang=\"en\">beds are small, but the room is spacious, staff is very attentive and friendly, decor was great, but interesting for a W hotel. A mix of modern chic, but classic looks as well. Can't complain either about the prices or location.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Let me start out by saying, I really wanted to like this hotel. <br>I booked two rooms there for my best friend's bachelorette party several months ago, and we stayed last Saturday. The location is wonderful if you're looking to be in the Loop, it is right in the midst of everything, and has wonderful views. The lobby is also beautiful. <br>HOWEVER, I was told that check in was at 3 pm. \\xa0A few of my friends and myself had arrived a bit before the bride to decorate.We arrived at 3:40 and were told our rooms were not cleaned yet, &amp; were offered a room \"for now\" to sit in. Obviously we were angry because we were not willing to decorate the room, only to vacate it in half an hour. Unfortunately they basically told us tough luck, and were told we'd be called once the rooms were ready. On the way up the elevator, before even reaching the loaner room, I received a call that the rooms were ready=/. Upon getting the keys we noticed that one was the loaner room, and one was on a completely different floor. When we got into the room we called and asked why the other room wasn't next door, considering they were booked together. The girl at the front desk told us that \"people who book two separate rooms usually do not want them together\". Hmmmmmm,really? Because I'm pretty sure every other time I've booked two rooms I've had them together.. Especially months in advance. After complaining about it for a bit on the phone, they said they were able to find us a room on the same floor (BRAVO!) <br>We were in a bit of a crunch for time, so we had to just get ready and go. When we left the hotel rooms, my other friends told me that the air conditioning in their room didn't even work!!! <br>When we got back to the hotel that night, both rooms were so humid that the pillows and bedding were moist. <br>It's a shame that such a pretty hotel was such a letdown because of customer service and poor upkeep by staff. <br>I will certainly not be returning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My stay at this hotel was great. The hotel is literally near everything. I was in town for Pitchfork so I wanted to be close to the park and to everything in the loop.<br><br>The hotel is walking distance to many of the tourist attractions and near every train to get you to anything else. I literally biked everywhere while I was there I barely touched my Ventra card the whole weekend. A Divvy station was right up the block so if you're into biking it's really convenient. <br><br>The staff was extremely nice. I arrived early around 10am ish and was able to check in right away despite there being a check in time at 3:00pm which was awesome!! Check in was super fast and easy. Kelly the young lady who checked me in offered suggestions for things to do and places to eat while in town but being that I've been to Chicago a handful of times I already kind of knew my way around but it's cool that she offered.<br><br>I stayed in the Wonderful Queen Room. The room was very clean and the decor was minimal. The room was a decent size being that I was traveling alone it may have been a tad bit crowded if I was with another person. The bathroom on the other hand was a little weird. The door didn't close completely shut because the space wasn't wide enough and it banged against the sink. The closet door was situated directly behind the bathroom door so it was difficult getting to the closet to hang things or access the safe. Fortunately things like that aren't much of a deal breaker for me but for some it may be a little weird. <br><br>Another plus was I had a late flight the day I checked out and I was able to stow my luggage and get my last bit of exploring done before heading back to O'Hare which was great. <br><br>All in all I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Chicago because the location was perfect, I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the hotel, the staff was super nice and to try IPO since I kept forgetting to :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I had a wonderful stay in 1406 at W Chicago City Center when I was in town for a conference. As a Starwood Platinum member the front desk gave me free internet, free breakfast for two, and a bunch of bonus points at check-in, and the breakfast was excellent with matching service. The bar has cool drinks - we got a couple of Polish Mules - and the room was spaciously oversized, cool, and quiet. <br><br>Pro tip: I was warned in advance to ask for a courtyard room because the rooms facing the street are loud and the elevated train can be annoying, but rooms on the 06 line are completely quiet. <br><br>Location is perfect, people are cool, and this hotel is awesome.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here for 3 nights while I was in Chicago for the first time. Overall, it was a decent hotel, but definitely not the best W I've stayed at.<br><br>It's in a great location, first of all. The CTA stop is right nearby and buses regularly right outside and around the block. For a tourist, it's a great place to be. You are a 5 minute walk to the Willis Tower and not too far from Millennium Park. Like any other W, it has a swanky lobby (a little on the smaller side--don't let the mirrors fool you) and a swanky bar and lots of mood lighting. They also have a business center with three computers you can use to print your boarding pass for free. I've seen this at other W hotels and I was glad this one had one as well. Overall the staff at the front desk is really nice, though I never saw a concierge at their desk during my time there.<br><br>This can be a very noisy hotel. If you get a room facing the train tracks it will be LOUD. Try to request a different room if there is one available. The rooms are generally on the smaller side (a single room might be too small for 2 average-sized people) and the bathroom in my room (I had a single with one queen bed) was TINY. The hallways were also FREEZING during my stay. They are also quite narrow, so if you get a room by the elevator you will hear a lot of elevator noise. The walls are also VERY thin here. I heard normal conversation next door (they were not yelling) and one night I had the opportunity to hear a vivid sex scene. Bring earplugs or a white noise machine if you are any bit sensitive to noise.<br><br>I did not try the IPO restaurant here. I did try room service, which was okay. The apple tart was yummy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

And at no time upon checking in, did they ask for my name, driver's license, or mention anything about \"registering\" me. \\xa0What was worst, was that upon asking for help, \\xa0and explaining the seriousness of the situation, the \"manager\" (Erica Wehrley) was completely uncooperative, and more so, uncaring.<br><br>To give you some idea: I pulled up the email confirmation for the room from my email to prove I had made the reservation (which I had the matching credit card for); I asked them to check security from last night to see me at the registration desk. \\xa0(Even gave the name of the person who sent us champagne); \\xa0I even offered to identify a prescription of my husbands by name and where it was exactly in the room, and have security go in the room to confirm. Erica denied each of these things and refused to let me in my room.<br><br>In all of this I was panicking even more - I didn't know where my husband was, I had no way to contact him, and now my hotel wouldn't even let me in. \\xa0I actually started crying, and felt I had no choice but to go back to the mall. \\xa0Erica was completely callous, uncaring, and even unkind through all of this. \\xa0On the way back to WaterTower, Iuckily, my husband made his way back to the hotel. \\xa0(We missed each other by 15 minutes) Unfortunately, though, finding out I had been denied entry, my husband felt the need to jump back in a cab, and go back to the mall. \\xa0<br><br>Due to dialysis, my husband's energy is limited, so this was becoming a bit much for him physically. \\xa0However, he really wanted to understand what had happened, so he called the hotel. \\xa0The front desk claimed Erica was \"busy\" and said she would call him back. \\xa0After an hour and no return call, he called again, now ready to simply move hotels. \\xa0Erica said we could do that, but she would not help us with a refund, as we prepaid. (Which trapped us at the W, as we have to stay in a very tight budget now with my husband no longer working) \\xa0Later, it was told to him that this policy was due to \"marital indiscretions,\" and that she would \"be commended\" by her management for \"doing her job.\" \\xa0<br><br>In the end, my husband ended up back in the hospital the next day. \\xa0Though I understand \"policy\" (which Erica feels she will be commended for), it seems to us that if they are going to be this strict about policy, they should DEFINITELY \"register\" the guests that they check in. \\xa0I would also hope for hotel managers that care more for their guests (and serious situations) than their \"commendations\" for protecting marital indiscretions. \\xa0<br><br>If you are cheating on your wife, this might be your place, but if you are a wife simply trying to make some final memories with your husband, the W is not interested in helping. \\xa0In fact, the W will not even let you into the room you paid for to let you wait for your (sick and lost) husband.

The king size bed was quite comfortable. The room didn't come with a coffee machine but they will send one up if you just ask for it. \\xa0<br>Our first night stay, they sent us champagne and a cheese and cracker platter to congratulate us on our marriage.

Room was pretty sizable and clean, the bathroom was amazing and again, CLEAN! The lobby was decked out in pink and chrome, very modern looking, I loved it! We visited the bar for an after-party, and it was pretty good. The drinks were alright, I wish there was more of a beer selection. I had the drunk munchies, so I got a burger and fries from the kitchen. The burger was just ok, kind of overcooked, but the fries it came with were phenomenal! We are definitely planning on staying at The W again in the near future! I would highly recommend it.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So disappointing. Checked in last night, guy at front desk wanted me to sign up for \"eco\" option. When i asked what that was, he said I would only get my room serviced for towels, bed, trash if I called. I explained I couldn't do that given I was working a trade show and had very limited time. Sooo I get back to my room after a long day at the show and sure enough the room had never been cleaned. No clean towels, nothing. So much for a quick shower before heading out to dinner. Called over a half hour ago and same guy at desk answered and told me he would send someone. Still waiting for someone to show up.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">When I come here I always enjoy the lounge with some good food and drinks. I love the environment and music played. It adds to my experience! Keep up the good work!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This hotel was amazing. If you come to Chicago this is the place to stay at. Everyone is super nice and so friendly</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The hotel is ok, however the food is horrible. \\xa0The quality of the food is as good as McDonald's but priced at 5 star hotel level. You're better off walking to another restaurant down the street and spending less and getting much better quality.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">W = WOW <br>W= Wonderful <br><br>I LOVED this hotel. \\xa0I am not really sure what all the bad reviews are about, but here is my perspective! <br><br>When you first walk in, you are greeted with a ton of awesome energy, delicious pastries and a friendly check- in desk person. <br><br>I had the room called the \"Wonderful\" room :) It lived up to the name. With a cozy bed, huge \\xa0tv, stocked mini bar, a ton of outlets and ports, it was spacious and was well ventilated. <br><br>The little touches made me love the hotel :) Things like the Bliss products, the awesome and friendly cleaning ladies, the trinkets in the room, the trendy vibe, etc... <br><br>Everything you need is walking distance. Food..check! Bookstores...check! Trains...check! Landmarks...check! Shopping...check! <br><br>While you are there, go to the gym! It is included with the room :). Need headphones? They have disposable ones ready for use! :) <br><br>The only con about the hotel is the super expensive snacks in the room! That problem, however is solved easily with the millions of Walgreens and food options in the area. <br><br>Stay at this hotel! You'll love it :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I called and had the absolute worst phone service I have ever had in my entire life. Simply trying to book the nicest room/suite available- and trying to find out what dates suites were available. I was talked down to, and then hung up on. Starwood should really get it together. I am sure that they are not worried about tarnishing their stellar reputation of being a \"cool\" place to stay, but in the hospitality industry a little hospitality would be appreciated. I am completely unimpressed.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The hotel itself is fine;clean, friendly, and everything you would expect from a W. Unless you are a businessperson in town for a meeting in this area or you are going to one of the theaters within walking distance of the hotel, this area is completely a ghost town outside of typical banking hours. My wife and I checked in on a Saturday night and went to find dinner in the area and everything was either closed or was closing as soon as possible.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The location was great, my boyfriend and I were within walking distance of many places. The hotel itself is very nice and decorated. The music though...well, felt like I was at an EDM show. Didn't really fit the vibe but I guess they were trying to be trendy? Our room was nice and clean, though it smelt like over-perfumed woman when we arrived? I know, confusing. The toiletries I enjoyed (Lemon-Sage Bliss). You definitely pay for the convenience at this hotel. My only letdown was how small the bathroom was and the placement of the door being in front of the toilet where you can see the person's silhouette...awkward when you have friends over to use the restroom before site-seeing. Also, for being such a high end hotel, no free wi-fi?! Super lame.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">A + for the lobby decor, it's a gorgeous hotel. However, rooms are very small and compact. As one reviewer mentioned they could barely get into and out of the bathroom, it is 100% true. I could barely flush the toilet and had hardly any room for my makeup on the sink. The bed was very comfortable though and I felt like the room was clean &amp; nicely decorated. We brought back food and drinks only to realize the fridge was pre-stocked and if we removed anything we would be charged. We got this hotel at a discounted rate so I would only recommend it if you don't have to pay full price.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We stayed here using one of those sites where you don't know the hotel until after you book. The room was nice although small, bed was comfy, but our view was nonexistent. For the price we paid, we probably could have done better booking something ourselves, but we felt like rolling the dice and trying it out.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This visit was a follow-up to another trip in May 2012. I had some minor issues and hotel management contacted me and invited me to come back. I booked my room via the SPG website. I received an email from the concierge a week or so before my arrival, which was a nice change from last time. I didn't specifically tell them I was coming because I wanted to experience the hotel without thinking that they were treating me special because I complained once.<br><br>Well, this time they gave me a lot more to complain about (and the issues were much more substantial than last time). It started when I had to wait 2 hours for my room despite requesting an earlier check-in. I totally understand that it's really them doing me a favor based on availability and clearly they were full this weekend.<br><br>While I was waiting I had my luggage stored and then asked the concierge for help booking the Acura Experience. By the time my room was ready the Acura Experience was already full. I found out there was still some availability at the time I reached out to the concierge (and for about an hour afterward). Clearly she neglected to reach out on my behalf and I missed out.<br><br>My room was finally ready and I gave the luggage guy my ticket to have it brought to my room. But for the fact that I was standing in line waiting to follow-up with the concierge, he would have given my suitcase to another guest. I saw him bring it to them and I purposely waited to intervene to see how he handled himself. When I finally said it was my bag the guest apologized, even though it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to do with the error. The luggage guy didn't say anything and I brought my bag upstairs myself.<br><br>I really wanted to settle in quickly so I could get my trip started and start coordinating meeting friends. The employees continually reminded me that check-ins aren't guaranteed until 3:00 PM. I realize that, but it was disappointing especially since they knew about my request at least a week prior to my arrival.<br><br>There were many other issues that came up and I'll save those specific details for management to address before adding them to a review. This hotel is no longer my first choice when coming to Chicago.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Being Platinum Elite members with Marriott, it was hard for us to make the call to stay at the W rather than the JW Marriott across the street, which is truly a great hotel. However, with a string of occasions of being let down by the Marriott brand, we are trying to switch over to Starwood, which led us to book at the W City Center for our stay in Chicago last week. \\xa0<br><br>The hotel location is not amazing, but not horrible. You can avoid highway traffic and car hassles by taking the train in from O'Hare and the hotel is only about 2.5 blocks away from the Quincy stop. We arrived at the hotel around 11am, fingers crossed for an early check in, but that was unavailable, which we totally understand. They checked our bags and directed us to a great cafe nearby for brunch. Seeing that we had our 3 year old with us, they took our phone numbers to call once the room was ready, but did say it was unlikely they could get us in before the 4pm check in...again, totally fine. We made the best of it, went to brunch, and saw a bit of Chicago.<br><br>A little before 4pm, we arrived back in the hotel lobby to see that there was a long line forming at the front desk. Long story short, it would turn out that we would not see our room until about 6pm that evening. I get sometimes things happen, but if check in is at 4pm, and we have been there since 11, it gets a bit frustrating. We just wanted to know WHEN we could expect to get a room as we were exhausted from a long day of travel. Just as we were about to cancel our reservation and book a Marriott, we were offered a couple drink vouchers, and Eden, the incredible concierge at this hotel, saved the day by bringing Candy Land over for our daughter to play. Both the drinks and the game were such thoughtful gestures, that we decided to give it another hour to see if we could get a room...and eventually, we did.<br><br>The room: small (and we were in an upgraded, larger room), and have the minimalist concept that you see in W brands. The bathroom was in need of a good, deep scrubbing of the grout and such, but otherwise fine. I personally can't stand Bliss products (full of chemicals) but it is nice to see the offering of something a little higher quality than generic hotel brands. \\xa0However, the bed was comfortable, the lighting/dimmers great, and the sound machine so nice to have. The chaise lounge was a perfect little bed for our daughter. There is absolutely \\xa0no view, but overall I like the more modern approach after staying in so many outdated Marriotts.<br><br>The standout of this hotel is absolutely the service. Eden made our stay so wonderful, and was always full of suggestions of fun things to see, do, and eat in Chicago that would be appropriate for our daughter as well. The bar staff is so kind, and would always sneak a little treat to our daughter if we were in the lobby/lounge...we stopped in for a drink one evening and the bartender brought her a glass of gummy bears (and asked permission from Mom and Dad first, which is always appreciated!). \\xa0Knowing that my husband had to work a full day on the day of our departure, they offered us a late checkout and then held our bags while we spent more time in the city. \\xa0I had to call for room service a couple times (extra blankets and towels) and they were always prompt and friendly to provide whatever we needed.<br><br>When we first arrived at this property, I was skeptical because of the location and was pretty sure we would not be staying here again. However, the great service and outstanding kindness of EVERY person we met at the W made us customers for each time we visit Chicago. Looking forward to match our status with Starwood and possibly bid Marriott a goodbye. :)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">I have some high standards set whenever I am staying at W hotel as they famous for the unique experience they offer.However my experience this time was just average here. I just felt I did not get proper attention which a customer should get who stays at W at the check in counter and kiosk.<br><br>The location though is nice and comfortable. Rooms were big , comfy and really nice. My room had an arcade.I just love the dark contrast of colors which W hotel uses.<br><br>Just wish the lobby was much more spacious.<br><br>FYI- This hotel has a restaurant attached called IPO, get the pancakes with banana from there.Those pancakes are plain heavenly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">So despite being a long time SPG fan, I stay here because it's one of a very few options we have for work. There is ALWAYS something wrong. ALWAYS. Beyond the fact that there are no drawers to unpack your clothes into. That aside, I thought maybe I was going to beat the streak when I got the upgrade. Got to my room, dirty dishes outside the door (6 pm). Housekeeping is still on the floor, surely they will take it. It's now nearly 10:00 and I just gave in and called Whatever Whenever to ask them to come take it away. Iron messed up. Ordered another one. Even more messed up than the first. Now waiting for replacement number two (it came: brand new in the box). Went into the bathroom to put away my stuff... and with one light on I see some rather dubious looking streaks on the wall. Seriously? If you have a choice, exercise it and stay somewhere else.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This location doesn't live up to the brand. \\xa0I should have seen the red flag when the reception referred to my room as \"boutique\", like calling a Manhattan apartment \"cozy\". \\xa0Seeing the room reminded me of a college dorm room. \\xa0You can't put bad art in a dumpy hotel and call it edgy. \\xa0I was able to get a bigger room which was hardly an improvement after complaining, but even then it still left me staring longingly at the JW Marriott across the street which was my usual when in town. \\xa0Chicago has much nicer hotels in the area for the price point.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Went here for the Vueve Clicqout event and had a blast. The lobby/bar seating area was packed but we managed to find a small area to sit. The DJ was playing good music, just the right volume, not too low but not overwhelming that you can hear each other talk. The ambiance is great and intimate, you're always in close proximity to other guests. We loved the set up and had a couple of glasses of wine.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">This hotel is a lot of smoke and mirrors. If you have ever stayed at a real W hotel you will be thoroughly disappointed. You can tell this place was rehabbed and rehabbed quickly. Its a very old building like most of Chicago's architecture but everything from the dull carpet, crappy paint job/condition of the baseboard molding in the hallways, the randomly placed art/paintings in the room, the wall paper, and dull lighting. 24 hours a day the hotel is dimly lite(probably to hided the imperfections. Parking is crazy expensive...but this is Chicago. Your best bet is to get a parking app for your phone there is plenty of cheaper parking in a 0.4-1mile radius instead of paying 53 dollars a night for parking for a contracted company by the hotel.<br><br> Very Poor Customer Service, valet was quick and efficient counter staff rude and \\xa0slow. \\xa0I arrived at 12am on a Friday night \\xa0staff was rude to other customers and took long checking other guest in while having private conversations. \\xa0No free wi fi in room , it took staff an hour and 30 min to bring me more towels and toiletries(no exaggeration) I called the front desk 3 times for the request, at 9am. I then asked can I pick them up myself because I needed to leave soon. Front desk explained they could not . I received my new towels and toiletry around 1130am. \\xa0When staff arrived at my room i explained i needed two sets. He then asked why? lol BECAUSE THERE IS TWO GUEST AND WE SHOWERED LAST NIGHT, WHY AM I EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU RIGHT NOW LOL. <br><br> pros: the rooms were extremely clean, bed was comfortable and I felt safe</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Right in the middle of the Loop, pretty much walkable to all sorts of places. I stayed here for a meeting for work, and have also stayed across the street at the JW. Very different properties. This is a typical W: hip, modern, with that classic \"Club W\" feel. <br><br>The rooms at this location are small, without question, even after I got a SPG Gold member upgrade; but you aren't staying in this hotel with 'staying in your room' in mind. It reminds me of staying in a hotel in New York: small, compact, efficient use of high value real estate. The rooms are typically appointed with W quality linens, beds, pillows and towels. The bathroom, much like the room, was a bit cramped, but again is all about space efficiency. <br><br>The bar downstairs, even on a Thursday night was surprisingly quiet. At 9:00 we were 3 of the 5 people in the bar grabbing a post work dinner/drink. It was surprisingly... the drink menu was creative, albeit more expensive than I would have imagined. <br><br>This W allows you to check into your room via the SPG app, and even use your iPhone as your roomkey (utilizing the bluetooth tech in the phone). It worked.... most of the time. My room door wasn't a problem, however the elevator was a constant struggle-- and I had to \"tailgate\" other people to use the elevator. Neat technology, but it didn't work consistently so I went back to a regular room key. <br><br>There is both a Starbucks and Dunkin next door (bonus!), and if you ask the concierge, they will give you a day pass to the Equinox gym a block away. <br><br>I am coming back to this property in a week, and have no reservations at all about that descision. Its in a great location,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">The location of this hotel, \\xa0and the courtesy of its staff is top notch. \\xa0 If you have meetings at Willis tower, this hotel cannot be beat. \\xa0However, \\xa0I found the hotel bathroom to be very small. \\xa0I don't think I would stay here again, \\xa0as it felt a little \"young\" for me, \\xa0but I would still reconnect it to others.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I personally don't like hotels, but will give credit to a good one! This hotel is cute \\xa0very small room and bathroom I think my college dorm was bigger then this! It's way to expensive a glass of wine was 11 bucks and the bottled water in my room was 5 bucks, I was going to give them one star but my stay has a upside, it was close to so good shopping food and the park the festival was at I walked everywhere and the bed is a huge cloud just don't hit your toe getting out the bed (it's that tight) oh the lighting in the bathroom was made by selfie gods</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Upon checking out, I was provided with a bill for $178.87, which reflected our parking and room service charges. This bill was accurate, and I have no problem with the amount. \\xa0However, when I checked my account the next morning, the hotel had ACTUALLY charged me a flat amount of $200, with no explanation. We did not damage the room (nor were we contacted about any potential damage). We did not use the minibar or eat/drink any of the provided food in the room that would explain the additional charges. Simply put, the hotel charged me an amount higher than that reflected in my bill. I have contacted them about the discrepancy and asked for an explanation, but have been repeatedly ignored.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I adore this hotel. \\xa0It is hip, it is swanky and it is my favorite hotel in Chicago. \\xa0What I like is the size of the rooms and the staff. \\xa0I have stayed here for work and utilized the facilities for a conference and a meeting. \\xa0It is intimate without being too small. \\xa0It can get busy on the weekends with weddings and event wanderers, but I consider that my time to \"people watch\".<br><br>The hotel is clean and my room was perfect. \\xa0Great space for my extended stay in Chicago and close to all of the action when I needed to escape my conference calls and laptop! \\xa0Close to many great sights and close to public transportation. \\xa0<br><br>I am a fan! \\xa0Yes, some of the amenities of this hotel can be pricey (valet, internet, cocktails), but if you can afford to stay in a hotel like this, get over it - it's not the Motel 6!</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">While there was nothing particularly wrong with the hotel, I just expect so much more from a W hotel. \\xa0I like basic and spartan, but the room had the feel of a hostel. \\xa0Typical swanky W lobby, but the rest of the hotel didn't quite measure up to the other Ws I've come to love.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I'm not sure what all the complaints are about - that said, I wasn't stuck in one of the smaller rooms. <br><br>I booked a regular room, which is normally small - but got upgraded for free to a spectacular room, which was huge and really nice. <br><br>The hotel had train noise, but what else do you expect in Chicago next to train lines? The room has everything it claimed and it was a very nice stay. Hotels in the same are were going for more money and were significantly less nice. I would definitely stay here again.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">My husband and I stayed here last month for our two year anniversary. The price was right for downtown and we had wanted to check out the W for some time, so we booked a Wonderful Room (keep in mind, Wonderful, Spectacular, etc are the names the hotel GIVES to their rooms.)<br><br>Check in was quick and painless. After explaining why we were staying, we asked if there were any room upgrades available. The associate explained that there were for a cost, but decided to upgrade us free of charge to a Spectacular Room. <br><br>Here's the deal. The guest service at W City Center was impeccable! All of our interactions with the front desk, concierge, bell staff and housekeeping were fantastic. Everyone was knowledgeable, patient and overall friendly, meeting all of our needs without a problem. <br><br>The hotel itself left something to be desired. And this is why I had to give it 3 stars. An overall statement would be I would have been a lot more excited if I were staying here in my early 20's. This is a trendy hotel with a dark lobby complete with lighting show in the evening (when we checked in.) The sexy trendy lobby music was loud enough to put me more in mind of being in Express than staying at a luxury hotel. The layout of the lobby was a bit confusing, so the front desk's location was not immediately apparent. However, they had a staff person directing you where to go, so we did not look too lost! Lol. <br><br>Our upgraded Spectacular room was nice with more space than the Wonderful room. but right away you notice how surrounded you are by other buildings. We were close enough to the building next to us that we could see that one unfortunate woman still had to work late on a Saturday. Judging from the back of her head, she was bummed. <br><br>We were okay with that until I was unpacking my carry-on bag on the chaise lounge on the room. I looked more carefully and noticed Monica Lewinsky-esque \"stains\" on the lounge!! They were too obvious to ignore, so we called down to the desk and they moved us. However, they downgraded us to the Wonderful room we originally booked. Too tired and ready for dinner to quibble, we actually liked the Wonderful room more than the Spectacular room. <br><br>Beware, the Wonderful Room is SMALL!! We appreciated the closeness since it was just us, but it was surprising to be so closed in. Our view was away from the lone office worker and of the El train this time. \\xa0<br><br>Another gross out was, when I went to get ice, I noticed that the ice machine room is shared with housekeeping. The reason I knew this is because there was a laundry chute labeled \"utility linen\" in the room. For some reason, the cleaning rags were all piled BENEATH the chute door instead of thrown down. It made for a gross and careless presentation. <br><br>Suffice to say, as appreciative as we were of the very friendly guest service staff, we failed to be impressed by the W City Center. Would we stay again? Maybe, but with so many other places to stay, we may just check it off of our bucket list and move on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We stayed in a tiny room on the 7th floor, facing the courtyard. it was reasonably quiet, but the cleaning crew sounding like a wrecking ball despite a DND sign hung on the door. It was impossible to sleep through their music and loud talking for what seemed like hours. You really can't fit two people in the bathroom at the same time, unless one is showering and one is at the sink.<br><br>The saving grace was the dirt cheap rate that I got through priceline for a location like this.</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Really nice and super modern hotel, which may not be for everyone. My room on the 19th floor was huge, and felt more like a mini apartment. The layout was nice and everything was easily accessible. I tried out the gym which was great, I loved that all cardio equipment had a touch screen and each machine had a TV. It got a bit crowded around 6am but then cleared out. The bar down stairs is also a nice place to hang out!</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We got a room for $200 a night. The room is really really small. It feels kind of cramped. <br><br>This place gets such a low rating from me because of the customer service we got. At the front desk, I asked if I could switch the room reservation to my wife so she could get the points and stays on her SPG account. Person checking us in said, \"no problem\" and put my wife's name and SPG number onto the room.<br><br>A few days later, I noticed that she didn't get credit for the room and they said, \"oh sorry, the person paying for the room gets the stays. But we can refund the amount and charge your wife's credit card if you want.\". Great, that works. They tell us to call later to the accounting department to get this done.<br><br>We call the accounting department later and they said that they don't know who we talked to, but there's no way they can do it. <br><br>After my negative experience at the W in Hollywood, CA combined with this one, I can pretty much guarantee I wouldn't stay at a W ever again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

Bathroom was very \"tight\". Air conditioning was only COLD or OFF; wouldn't allow us to set to WARM. So Room was very COLD at night. (bed comforter too thick &amp; hot). Walls are \"thin\" - rude inconsiderate neighbors were annoying between 10:30 &amp; 1 AM every night keeping us awake. \\xa0The TV was horrific. Only the local channels worked properly. Any of the \"Cable\" channels (HBO, etc) had serious stop/start fits that made them unwatchable. Small rooms. And a DVD Player? \\xa0Seriously?<br><br>To make matters worse, after we were told our bill was \"clean\" and no additional charges, the Hotel charged us for Mini-Bar even though we never used it ! \\xa0(waiting for call-back from \"Accounting\" to credit - have left messages for Accounting to call me now 2 days in a row. Can't even talk to a real person ... yet .. really nice way to treat your guests ... NOT ...)<br><br>update: \\xa0Finally received call back from \"Accounting\". \\xa0The rep. was very nice and is to handle the incorrect charge. Apologized. To be credited to our card in the next week or 2.<br><br>All in all, find another hotel - seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Bring your ear plugs! You can hear a lot of the city noise from inside the room. The rooms can be small/cramped unless you get upgraded.<br><br>The elevators are small and take awhile so give yourself enough time in the morning to get downstairs, or alternatively take the stairs.<br><br>Room service of fairly quick and was pleasantly surprised by the cup of gummy bears that was included with my dinner.<br><br>The location is good as it is about a mile walk to millennium park and other places to visit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Great stay in Chicago and so close to Union Station and city center. \\xa0Converted old hotel, so rooms and baths are small, but nice, of course. TV didn't work, but didn't try to fix it. Just headed to the cool lobby (Living Room) for free wifi. Always a great experience at W.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I stayed here about a month ago for the first time. Got a great deal on Priceline. Although I had 1 minor issue my overall stay was enjoyable. The lobby is nice although I didn't get to hang out down there. Next time I definitely will. Will be back.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Sorry, W. You cannot tout yourselves as a cool, hip, luxury brand, charge premium prices and then NOT expect the kind of backlash you get for sticking your guests in these \"cozy\" rooms. If you take such great pains to carefully construct a WOW experience and image, you better be able to stand by that on all accounts.<br><br>And not just try to explain it away with \"That is how the building was built in the 1920s. Here is free Wifi. Deal.\"<br><br>Not when there are plenty of other 4 star hotels in the area with larger rooms and standard free wifi for similar pricing.<br><br>We stayed the previous night (Friday) at another 4 star hotel for or a wedding. That next morning (Saturday) we decided to stay in the city another night just for fun. And despite the great room and great rate from the other hotel, we decided to be adventurous and try another hotel in the area neither of us had ever stayed at before.<br><br>I've always had great experiences at Starwood properties, but never had never booked at a W before. So we grabbed a room at the W City Center that morning for a 1 night stay. <br><br>And earning more SPG points couldn't hurt either, right?<br><br>I realize due to the last minute nature in our booking, we probably would not be allotted one of the BEST rooms, but I really did not expect to be stuck in an updated version of an IKEA hobbit hole. With a bathroom that was, no joke, no bigger than 3x3 feet with a door that would not slide all the way shut.<br><br>Yes, we'd fallen victim to the \"cozy room\" booking. Yes, I realize the rooms are that size \"due to the original 1920s architecture\" blah blah blah and that's fine. <br><br>That is fine for literally any other non-premium hotel brand. <br><br>Again, if you are going to take such pains to craft a cool and hip 4-star image, you cannot explain-away the disappointment expressed by your bookers. Unless you charged SIGNIFICANTLY less than the larger rooms.<br><br>Oh and the \"free\" wireless guests banished to the \"cozy\" rooms receive? Might be a nice perk if it weren't so slow. Do not expect to do any work that might require anything other than email or internet browsing. Streaming video is definitely out.<br><br>Then again I am not sure how much time you can physically spend in your \"cozy room\" outside of sleeping.<br><br>CONS:<br>--It is not physically possible to get ready for anything in the bathroom. No space for toiletries and other items. Good luck trying to dry off IN the bathroom.<br><br>--No iPhone/iPod dock anywhere in the room (despite being advertised on the on website)<br><br>--Janky clock radio you could get at Walgreens for $4.99.<br><br>--Janky power strip casually laid out on top of the side table.<br><br>---HAIRS HAIRS HAIRS! I did a bed-bug check as I do in any hotel room I book, and while there were zero signs of bed bugs, there were sure a lot of different hairs underneath the mattress cover. So gross.<br><br>PROS:<br>---Apparently we were lucky to get a room with a view of the \"courtyard\" (fire escapes and alley + hotel lobby rooftop and no sunlight) because it is quieter?<br>---Bath products are nice<br>---The towels are incredible. Seriously, the best.<br>---The lobby looks very comfortable for lounging.<br><br>We definitely should have stayed at our original hotel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">Had a great experience here. Friendly and helpful staff across the board! \\xa0They ensured all my needs were taken care if, but not in a \"this is my job so I have to\" kind of way. Genuine, pleasant and cheerful. \\xa0Got upgraded when I first checked in, was able to access my room early, clean and nice size rooms. \\xa0Overall I couldn't have ask for more. <br><br>Will definitely be back!</br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I love the W. \\xa0I really love the W. It's my go to hotel. \\xa0So naturally when I visited Chicago I skimmed through a few hotels on yelp and trip advisor but ultimately chose the W Citycenter. \\xa0<br><br>Mistake. Now don't misunderstand, the rooms weren't terrible. \\xa0A little small but comfortable and the bed was luscious as always. My disappointment was with the hotel itself. \\xa0It was the dullest W I have ever stayed at. \\xa0My favorite part of staying at the W is the nightlife. \\xa0Usually the bars a buzzing with excitement. \\xa0After dinner drinks at the bar, late night rendezvous at the lounge. Not this W. \\xa0The bar is nonexistent. \\xa0Literally located in the lobby, it consist of a tiny bar slab with 6 stools and two cocktail tables. <br><br>Another very important point that I wish someone would of explained to me is that this W is located in their financial district. \\xa0The location is great for museums. \\xa0There are lots of eateries and everything is SHORT cab ride away. \\xa0However, if you want to stay where the party is...bars, restaurants and lounges, you need to cross the bridge and head over to the North Side.</br></br></br></br></p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">We came here for a weekend trip in July. The hotel is in a great location in the South Loop within walking distance to the L. The staff was very friendly and accomadating. After mentioning that we were there for a special occasion, the front desk sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne and some chocolate-covered strawberries. A perfect gift to start the weekend off right. In this case, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable even more than what I'm typically used to when staying at Starwood properties. The room was spacious and very comfortable. We used the workout room in the morning and there was plenty of equipment for people to use even though there were 6-8 people in the room when I was working out. The only negative is that there wasn't really a view but I didn't really expect to get one with the building being in the middle of the South Loop and surrounded by other skyscrapers.</p>,\n",
       " <p lang=\"en\">I mean eh? First let me warn you that the rooms are VERY small, maybe 100 sq feet. The rooms are so small that if you leave your suitcase out you will have to walk over it to get to the bathroom. The rooms are very modern and updated but you can definitely see wear and tear. Beds are comfy and plush which is nice. Overall staff was extremely helpful and welcoming and went above and beyond to make sure you feel comfortable. Prices are pretty extravagant for food. Ordered yogurt and granola with fruit and coffee, and the total came to $40! Overall I think the hotel and rooms could be great if it weren't for the room size and overall costs.</p>]"
